### **Backdoors, Easter Eggs, & Logic Bombs Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concepts & Definitions**

| Term | Definition | Key Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backdoor** | A covert method of **bypassing normal authentication or security controls** in a system. | • Originally placed by programmers for maintenance access.<br>• Now considered a **horrible security practice** and a breach of secure coding.<br>• A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a modern, malicious version of a backdoor. |
| **Easter Egg** | A **hidden feature, joke, or novelty** within a program, inserted by the developers. | • Generally harmless (e.g., Google's "do a barrel roll").<br>• **Security Risk:** This code is often added last-minute and **doesn't undergo rigorous security testing**, making it a potential vulnerability. |
| **Logic Bomb** | A piece of **malicious code** that is inserted into a program and is set to **execute a harmful action only when specific conditions are met**. | • Defined by its **trigger-based execution**.<br>• Often placed by **insider threats** (e.g., disgruntled employees).<br>• **Example (Movie):** In *Jurassic Park*, Dennis Nedry's code shuts down the park's power at a specific time. |

#### **2. Deeper Dive & Examples**

*   **Backdoors:**
    *   **Historical Use:** In the 1980s-2000s, programmers used them for easy system access for maintenance, bypassing firewalls and authentication.
    *   **Modern Equivalent:** **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**. These are installed by attackers through methods like phishing and create a callback connection, acting as a malicious backdoor for persistent access.

*   **Easter Eggs:**
    *   **Purpose:** Fun, inside jokes, or hidden secrets.
    *   **The Security Problem:** They represent **unauthorized and untested code**. Because they are treated as harmless novelties, they skip the formal security review process, creating potential weak points in the application that attackers can exploit.

*   **Logic Bombs:**
    *   **How They Work:** The code lies dormant until a **specific trigger condition** is met. Common triggers include:
        *   A specific date and time.
        *   The deletion of a specific user account (e.g., a disgruntled employee's account).
        *   A particular command from the attacker.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** Once triggered, they can delete files, transfer money, shut down systems, or drop other malware.

#### **3. The Common Thread: Insecure Coding Practices**

All three of these represent serious lapses in secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices.

*   **Backdoors** bypass security by design.
*   **Easter Eggs** introduce untested, unauthorized functionality.
*   **Logic Bombs** are the malicious evolution of this concept, intentionally hiding destructive code.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Backdoors, Easter Eggs, and Logic Bombs should never be included in modern applications.** They violate secure coding standards.
*   A **Backdoor** is an intentional bypass of security. A **RAT** is its malicious counterpart.
*   An **Easter Egg** is a seemingly harmless hidden feature that introduces **security risks due to a lack of testing**.
*   A **Logic Bomb** is a **time-delayed or condition-based attack** often used by insider threats.
*   **Defense Strategy:** Organizations must scan their **custom-developed applications** for these vulnerabilities and enforce strict secure coding practices that forbid such code.
