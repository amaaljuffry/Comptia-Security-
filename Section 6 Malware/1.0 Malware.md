### **Malware Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concepts**

*   **Malware Definition:**
    *   **Mal**icious + Soft**ware**.
    *   Any software designed to infiltrate, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system without the user's knowledge or consent.

*   **Key Components of an Attack:**
    *   **Threat Vector:** The *path or method* an attacker uses to reach a target system (the "how" they plan to break in).
        *   *Examples:* Unpatched software, USB drives, phishing emails.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The *specific steps and exploits* used to gain access and deliver the malware (the execution of the plan).
        *   *Example:* Scanning for a specific unpatched vulnerability and then running an exploit against it.

    *   **Analogy: Cupcake Infiltration**
        *   **Goal:** Place a cupcake (malware) on your kitchen table (the system).
        *   **Threat Vector:** Your unguarded neighborhood (the vulnerability).
        *   **Attack Vector:** Driving to your house, picking the lock, and walking inside (the series of actions).

*   **Real-World Example: WannaCry Ransomware**
    *   **Threat Vector:** Unpatched Windows systems (missing MS17-010 patch for EternalBlue).
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Automated scans to find unpatched machines.
        2.  Exploit the vulnerability to gain administrative access.
        3.  Install ransomware to encrypt files and demand payment.

#### **2. Types of Malware (Objective 2.4)**

| Malware Type | Description | Key Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virus** | Malicious software that attaches to a clean file. | Spreads throughout a system, often corrupting or damaging host files. |
| **Worm** | Standalone malware that self-replicates. | Spreads across networks, often by exploiting software vulnerabilities. |
| **Trojan** | Malicious program disguised as legitimate software. | Grants attackers unauthorized access once executed. Does not self-replicate. |
| **RAT** | **R**emote **A**ccess **T**rojan. | A type of Trojan that gives an attacker full remote control of a victim's computer. |
| **Ransomware** | Malware that encrypts user data. | Holds data hostage until a ransom is paid for the decryption key. |
| **Zombie** | A single compromised computer remotely controlled by an attacker. | --- |
| **Botnet** | A **Net**work of compromised computers (**Bots**/Zombies). | Used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or crypto mining. |
| **Rootkit** | Malicious tools designed to hide their presence and activities. | Operates at or below the OS level to maintain privileged access. |
| **Backdoor** | A method of bypassing normal authentication to gain unauthorized access. | Often implanted by malware or a threat actor during an attack. |
| **Logic Bomb** | A piece of code embedded inside a legitimate program. | Executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger is met. |
| **Keylogger** | Software or hardware that records a user's keystrokes. | Used to capture passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. |
| **Spyware** | Software that secretly monitors and gathers user information. | Sends collected data to third parties without user consent. |
| **Bloatware** | Unnecessary or pre-installed software on a device. | Consumes system resources and space without providing value to the user. |

#### **3. Malware Attack Techniques & Infection Vectors**

*   **Evolution:** Attack methods have moved from simple file-based infections to more advanced techniques.
*   **Fileless Malware:** Leaves minimal traces by using built-in system tools and living in memory (RAM).
*   **Common Techniques:**
    *   Multi-stage deployments.
    *   Obfuscation to avoid detection.
    *   Leveraging legitimate system tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI) to perform malicious actions.

#### **4. Indications of a Malware Attack**

A cybersecurity professional must be able to recognize these signs:
*   **Account Lockouts**
*   **Concurrent Session Utilization** (same account logged in from multiple places)
*   **Blocked Content** (by security tools)
*   **Impossible Travel** (account accessed from geographically impossible locations in a short time)
*   **Increased Resource Consumption** (CPU, RAM, network)
*   **Resource Inaccessibility** (files, systems, or services become unavailable)
*   **Out-of-Cycle Logging / Missing Logs** (logs are generated at strange times or are deleted)
*   **Documented Attacks** (known attacks reported in your environment)

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Malware** is a broad category encompassing many types of malicious software.
*   Understand the critical difference between a **Threat Vector** (the vulnerability) and an **Attack Vector** (the exploitation steps).
*   Memorize the different types of malware, their definitions, and key behaviors for the exam (focus on **Objective 2.4**).
*   Modern malware uses advanced techniques like **fileless execution** and abuse of **built-in system tools**.
*   Recognizing the **indicators of compromise** is essential for rapid detection and response.
