### **Virus & RAT Demonstration Study Notes**

#### **1. Demonstration Overview & Disclaimer**

*   **Purpose:** To show how easily attackers can create and deploy basic viruses and RATs.
*   **Lab Environment:** Uses known-vulnerable, **out-of-date systems** (e.g., Windows 7) without modern security patches or antivirus. **This would likely be blocked on a modern, patched system.**
*   **Ethical Note:** The tools shown are for educational demonstration only. Creating and deploying malware on systems you do not own is illegal.

#### **2. Virus Demonstration (Nuisance Attack)**

*   **Tool Used:** JPS Virus Maker 3.0
*   **Attack Method:**
    1.  Attacker uses a point-and-click tool to select malicious functions (e.g., "Crazy Mouse").
    2.  The tool generates a malicious executable file.
    3.  The file is delivered to the victim via **social engineering** (e.g., disguised as a game or picture).
    4.  The victim executes the file.
*   **Observed Impact:** The "Crazy Mouse" virus caused the victim's cursor to jump around the screen erratically, making the computer unusable. This is a **nuisance attack** designed to disrupt normal operation.

#### **3. Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Demonstration (Full Compromise)**

*   **Tool Used:** ProRat
*   **Attack Method:**
    1.  **Create the Payload:** The attacker configures a "server" (the RAT payload) with settings like:
        *   Connection port.
        *   A password for the attacker to connect.
        *   **Bind with a File:** The malicious server is hidden (bound) within a legitimate-looking file (e.g., a desert picture).
        *   **Icon Spoofing:** The `.exe` file is given a JPEG icon to trick the user.
    2.  **Delivery:** The payload is delivered via social engineering.
    3.  **Execution:** The victim runs the file, sees the decoy (the picture), and the RAT is silently installed.
    4.  **Connection:** The attacker connects from their machine to the victim's using the RAT client and password.
*   **Observed Impact & Attacker Capabilities:**
    Once connected, the attacker has **full remote control** over the victim's machine. Demonstrated capabilities included:
    *   **Information Gathering:** Retrieving system info (computer name, users, etc.).
    *   **Surveillance:** Viewing the victim's web history, taking screenshots, and accessing their webcam.
    *   **System Manipulation:** Sending pop-up messages, hiding/showing desktop icons, flipping the screen, and controlling the mouse.
    *   **Data Theft:** Browsing and transferring files via FTP.
    *   **Persistence:** The RAT provides ongoing, remote access.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Ease of Creation:** Point-and-click tools lower the technical barrier for creating malware, making it accessible to low-skill attackers (**script kiddies**).
*   **Delivery is Key:** Both attacks relied **100% on social engineering** to trick the user into executing the malicious file.
*   **The Power of a RAT:** A Remote Access Trojan provides an attacker with extensive control over a victim's system, turning it into a puppet for espionage, data theft, or further attacks.
*   **Defense Strategy:**
    *   **User Training:** Educate users to be wary of unsolicited files and downloads.
    *   **Up-to-Date Systems:** Keep operating systems and software patched.
    *   **Robust Antivirus:** Use modern, updated antivirus/anti-malware solutions.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Users should not have administrative rights for daily tasks, which can prevent the installation of many malware variants.
