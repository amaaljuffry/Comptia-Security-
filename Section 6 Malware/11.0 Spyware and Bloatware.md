| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intent** | Malicious - Theft of information | Commercial - Marketing and promotions |
| **Primary Danger** | **Loss of confidentiality**, identity theft, financial fraud | **System performance degradation** and **increased security risk** |
| **How it Gets On a System** | Bundled with other software, malicious websites, deceptive pop-ups (phishing). | Pre-installed by the device manufacturer or vendor. |
