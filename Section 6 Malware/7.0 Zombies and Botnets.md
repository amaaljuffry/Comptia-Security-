### **Botnets & Zombies Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Definitions**

*   **Botnet:** A **network of compromised computers or devices** that are controlled remotely by a malicious actor (bot herder). The name comes from "**robot network**."
*   **Zombie:** A **single compromised computer or device** that is part of a botnet. It performs tasks under the remote command of the attacker without the user's knowledge.

#### **2. How Botnets Work**

1.  **Infection:** Computers are infected with malware (e.g., a worm or Trojan) that turns them into **zombies**.
2.  **Command & Control (C2/C&C):** The attacker uses a central server, known as a **Command and Control (C2) node**, to send instructions to all the zombies in the botnet.
3.  **Execution:** The zombies simultaneously carry out the commands received from the C2 node.

#### **3. Common Uses of Botnets**

Botnets are used to harness the collective power of thousands of compromised devices for malicious purposes.

| Use Case | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** | **Most common use.** Overwhelms a target server or network with traffic from thousands of zombies, making it unavailable to legitimate users. |
| **Spam & Phishing Campaigns** | Uses the zombies to send out massive volumes of spam emails and phishing attempts to spread malware or steal credentials. |
| **Cryptocurrency Mining (Crypto-jacking)** | Uses a portion of the zombies' processing power (CPU/GPU) to mine cryptocurrency. The profits are sent to the attacker's digital wallet. |
| **Brute-Force Attacks** | Uses the distributed computational power of the botnet to break encryption by trying millions of password or key combinations. |
| **Pivoting & Anonymity** | Uses zombies as proxies to launch attacks, making it harder to trace the activity back to the original attacker. |
| **Illegal Content Storage** | Distributes and stores illegal data (e.g., pirated software, child pornography) across many zombies to avoid detection. |

#### **4. Stealth and Evasion**

To avoid detection, attackers are careful not to fully consume a zombie's resources. They typically use only **20-25% of the processing power**. This ensures:
*   The computer remains responsive enough that the user doesn't suspect a problem.
*   The malicious activity is less likely to be noticed in task manager or system monitors.
*   The botnet can maintain a large, stable network of zombies over a long period.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Botnet = Network of compromised devices.**
*   **Zombie = A single compromised device in the botnet.**
*   **C2 Node = The central server used by the attacker to control the botnet.**
*   The primary power of a botnet comes from the **distributed, collective resources** of its zombies.
*   **DDoS attacks** are the most common use of botnets.
*   Attackers use **low resource consumption** on each zombie to maintain stealth and longevity of their botnet.
