### **Computer Viruses Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept**

*   **Definition:** A computer virus is a piece of **malicious code** that runs on a machine **without the user's knowledge**.
*   **Infection Method:** It infects a system when its code is executed, often triggered by a **user action** (e.g., opening a file, installing a program).
*   **Common Vectors:** Downloaded files (e.g., games, software installers) containing hidden malicious code.
*   **Malicious Activities:** Once active, a virus can:
    *   **Replicate** and spread across a network.
    *   **Delete or corrupt** critical files.
    *   **Consume** valuable computing resources.

#### **2. The 10 Types of Viruses**

| Type of Virus        | Description & Key Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Boot Sector**   | • Infects the **first sector** of a storage drive (HDD/SSD).<br>• Loads into memory **before the OS boots**, making it hard to detect.<br>• Removal requires specialized anti-virus (e.g., from a network scanner or a live boot disc).                                          |
| **2. Macro**         | • Embeds malicious code within **documents** (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint).<br>• Executes when the infected document is opened.<br>• Relies on **social engineering** to trick users into enabling macros.                                                                     |
| **3. Program Virus** | • Infects **executable application files** (e.g., `.exe`, `.com`).<br>• Embeds itself in a legitimate program (e.g., Microsoft Word).<br>• Re-infects the system **every time the infected program is run**.                                                                     |
| **4. Multipartite**  | • A **hybrid** virus that combines **boot sector** + **program** virus techniques.<br>• Gains **persistence** by infecting both the boot sector and program files.<br>• Difficult to eradicate; removing one part (the program) may leave the other (boot sector) active.        |
| **5. Encrypted**     | • **Encrypts its payload** to hide from signature-based anti-virus detection.<br>• The malicious code is scrambled into ciphertext, making it unreadable to scanners.                                                                                                            |
| **6. Polymorphic**   | • An **advanced encrypted virus**.<br>• **Changes its code (mutates)** each time it infects a new file by altering its decryption module.<br>• Evades detection by changing its "signature."                                                                                     |
| **7. Metamorphic**   | • A **more advanced version** of a polymorphic virus.<br>• **Completely rewrites its own code** before infecting a new file.<br>• Even more effective at avoiding signature-based detection.                                                                                     |
| **8. Stealth**       | • A **technique**, not a distinct virus type, used to avoid detection.<br>• Employs various methods (like encryption or payload modification) to hide from anti-virus software.                                                                                                  |
| **9. Armored**       | • Has a **protective layer** designed to confuse and obstruct analysis.<br>• Makes it difficult for security professionals or reverse-engineering tools to understand the virus code.                                                                                            |
| **10. Hoax**         | • **Technically NOT a virus.** It is a form of **technical social engineering**.<br>• **Tricks users** into believing their computer is infected to scare them into an undesirable action (e.g., installing real malware, paying for fake tech support, granting remote access). |

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   A virus requires **user action** to execute and initiate infection.
*   Modern viruses often **combine multiple types** (e.g., an encrypted, metamorphic, multipartite virus) to increase their potency and evade detection.
*   **Macro** and **Program** viruses rely on infecting host files to execute.
*   **Boot Sector** and **Multipartite** viruses are focused on **persistence** and are hard to remove.
*   **Encrypted, Polymorphic, and Metamorphic** viruses are primarily focused on **evading detection** by anti-virus software.
*   A **Hoax** is a social engineering attack, not a virus itself.
