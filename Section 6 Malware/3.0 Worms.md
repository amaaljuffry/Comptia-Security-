### **Computer Worms Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept & Definition**

*   **Definition:** A worm is a piece of **malicious software** that can **self-replicate** and spread across a network.
*   **Key Differentiator from a Virus:**
    *   **Virus:** Requires **user action** to execute (e.g., opening a file, clicking a link).
    *   **Worm:** Spreads **automatically** without any user intervention.

#### **2. How Worms Spread**

*   Worms exploit **vulnerabilities** in operating systems and applications.
*   They actively **scan networks** (both internal and the internet) for unpatched, vulnerable systems.
*   If a vulnerability is found, the worm uses an **exploit** to infect the machine and continue spreading.

#### **3. The Dangers & Impact of Worms**

Worms are dangerous for two primary reasons:

1.  **Infection and Compromise:**
    *   They infect workstations and other computing assets.
    *   Compromised machines can be added to **botnets** for other malicious purposes (e.g., DDoS attacks, spam).

2.  **Network Disruption & Denial-of-Service:**
    *   The constant replication and scanning consume massive amounts of:
        *   **Network bandwidth**
        *   **Processing power (CPU)**
        *   **Memory (RAM)**
    *   This can severely slow down or completely overwhelm systems, leading to a **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** condition.

#### **4. Historical Worm Examples**

| Worm Name | Key Facts & Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nimda (2001)** | • "Nimda" is "admin" spelled backwards.<br>• Demonstrated rapid propagation, infecting the entire internet in **just 22 minutes**. |
| **Conficker (2009)** | • One of the largest worms ever, infecting **9-15 million machines**.<br>• Exploited a critical Windows vulnerability patched in **MS08-067** (related to file and printer sharing).<br>• Created a massive botnet that was luckily dismantled by security professionals before being used for major attacks. |

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Autonomous Spread:** The defining feature of a worm is its ability to spread **without user action**.
*   **Exploitation is Key:** They propagate by exploiting **unpatched software vulnerabilities**.
*   **Dual Threat:** Worms pose a dual threat by both **infecting systems** and **consuming resources** to the point of causing network outages.
*   **Defense Strategy:** The primary defense against worms is **vigilant patch management** and the use of **network security controls** to detect and block scanning and exploitation attempts.
