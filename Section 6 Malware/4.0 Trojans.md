### **Trojans & RATs Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept & Historical Analogy**

*   **Origin:** Named after the "Trojan Horse" from Greek history. The Greeks gifted a large wooden horse to the city of Troy, which secretly contained soldiers inside. Once inside the city walls, the soldiers emerged and opened the gates for the invading army.
*   **Cybersecurity Definition:** A **Trojan** is a piece of **malicious software** that is **disguised** as a legitimate, harmless, or desirable piece of software.

#### **2. How Trojans Work**

*   **Social Engineering:** Relies on tricking the user into installing it by promising a useful function (e.g., a game, a utility, a crack).
*   **Dual Functionality:**
    1.  It **does perform** the advertised function (e.g., the game Tetris will run).
    2.  It **simultaneously performs** a malicious action in the background.
*   **Common Malicious Payloads:**
    *   Installing a **backdoor** for persistent access.
    *   Dropping other malware (e.g., a **virus** or **ransomware**).
    *   **Data exfiltration** (stealing sensitive documents).
    *   Providing **remote control** to an attacker.

#### **3. Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**

*   **Definition:** A specific, common type of Trojan that provides an attacker with **full remote control** over a victim's machine.
*   **Historical Example: Infected Tetris**
    *   A popular game was bundled with malicious code.
    *   When users ran the game, it secretly opened a connection back to the attacker's system.
    *   The attacker could then perform actions on the victim's computer, such as:
        *   Opening/closing the CD drive.
        *   Playing sounds.
        *   Manipulating the display (e.g., flipping the screen).
        *   Logging keystrokes.

#### **4. The Dangers & Purpose of Trojans**

Trojans are used by attackers to:
*   **Exploit vulnerabilities** in a workstation.
*   **Conduct data exfiltration.**
*   **Create backdoors** for persistence.
*   Gain **remote access and control** (in the case of a RAT).

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Disguise is Key:** The defining feature of a Trojan is that it **masquerades as a legitimate program**.
*   **User Action Required:** Unlike worms, Trojans require **user interaction** to be installed and executed.
*   **RATs are a Major Threat:** Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a particularly dangerous type of Trojan that gives attackers remote control, turning a victim's computer into a puppet.
*   **Defense Strategy:**
    *   **Exercise caution** when downloading and installing software, especially from untrusted sources.
    *   Use **anti-virus/anti-malware** solutions to scan downloads.
    *   Keep systems **patched** to prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities by the Trojan's payload.
