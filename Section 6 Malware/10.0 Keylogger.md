### **Keyloggers Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept & Definition**

*   **Definition:** A keylogger is a piece of **software or hardware** that **records every keystroke** made on a computer or mobile device.
*   **Origin:** Originally developed as a legitimate **troubleshooting tool** for system administrators.
*   **Modern Use:** **Weaponized by cybercriminals** to steal sensitive information directly as it is typed.
*   **Data Captured:** Usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, confidential emails, and web searches.

#### **2. Types of Keyloggers**

| Type | Description | Pros (for attackers) / Cons (for defenders) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software-Based** | A malicious program installed on the victim's computer. | • **Easy to deploy at scale** (via phishing, bundled software).<br>• Can be sophisticated enough to **evade antivirus detection**. |
| **Hardware-Based** | A **physical device** plugged into the computer (e.g., inline between the keyboard and USB port, or disguised as a USB drive). | • **Immune to software-based detection** (anti-malware scans).<br>• **Harder to deploy widely**; used for **targeted attacks**. |

#### **3. The Risks & Impact**

*   **For Individuals:**
    *   Identity theft
    *   Financial fraud (unauthorized bank transactions/purchases)
*   **For Organizations (Corporate Espionage):**
    *   Theft of login credentials
    *   Exposure of confidential emails and proprietary data
    *   Loss of competitive advantage
    *   Financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions

#### **4. Protection & Mitigation Strategies**

A multi-layered defense is crucial to protect against both software and hardware keyloggers.

1.  **Regular Updates & Patching:**
    *   Keep operating systems and software updated to patch vulnerabilities keyloggers could exploit.

2.  **Quality Antivirus/Anti-Malware:**
    *   Use comprehensive security software to **detect and quarantine** software keyloggers.
    *   Conduct **regular scans**.

3.  **Phishing Awareness Training:**
    *   Train users to **recognize and avoid** phishing emails, a primary delivery method for software keyloggers.

4.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **This is a critical defense.** Even if a password is stolen, the attacker cannot log in without the second factor (e.g., authenticator app code, fingerprint).

5.  **Keystroke Encryption:**
    *   Use security software that **encrypts keystrokes** before they are processed by the system. A keylogger would only capture unusable **ciphertext**.

6.  **Physical Security Checks:**
    *   **Inspect hardware regularly**, especially in sensitive environments. Look for unfamiliar devices connected between the keyboard and the computer.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   Keyloggers are a significant threat to **confidentiality**.
*   They come in two forms: **software** (common, scalable) and **hardware** (targeted, stealthy).
*   The impact ranges from **personal identity theft** to **corporate espionage**.
*   **Defense is multi-layered:** Combine **technical controls** (AV, MFA, encryption) with **human training** (phishing awareness) and **physical security** (hardware checks).
*   **MFA is one of the most effective countermeasures**, as it neutralizes the value of a stolen password.
