### 🔍 Overview

Understanding **threat actor attributes** is essential for identifying how attackers operate, what resources they have, and how dangerous they can be.  
These attributes—combined with their motivations—help cybersecurity professionals anticipate attacks and create effective defenses.

### 1. 🏠 Internal vs. External Threat Actors

#### **Internal Threat Actors**

- **Definition:** Individuals **within** the organization who misuse legitimate access.
- **Examples:** Employees, contractors, or business partners.
- **Motivations:** Revenge, financial gain, coercion, or negligence.
- **Risk:** High — due to insider knowledge of systems and vulnerabilities.
- **Example Case:**
> A Coca-Cola employee steals the company’s secret formula and sells it to Pepsi.

#### **External Threat Actors**

- **Definition:** Individuals or groups **outside** the organization attempting unauthorized access.
- **Types:** Cybercriminals, hacktivists, competitors, nation-state actors.
- **Techniques Used:** Malware, phishing, DDoS attacks, or social engineering.
- **Access Level:** No legitimate access—must break in.

### 2. 💰 Resources and Funding

The **amount of resources and funding** determines how powerful or persistent a threat actor can be.

|**Threat Actor Type**|**Resources**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|Low-resource attacker|Basic tools, limited skills, single computer|Individual hacker|
|Well-funded organization|Advanced malware, team of experts, high computing power|Nation-state or APT group|

**Key Point:**
- More funding = More sophisticated attacks (e.g., zero-day exploits, multi-stage campaigns).
### 3. ⚙️ Sophistication and Capability

**Definition:**  
Refers to the threat actor’s **technical skills**, the **complexity** of tools used, and their **ability to evade detection**.
#### Levels of Sophistication:

|**Level**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Low (Script Kiddies)**|Use pre-made scripts or tools without deep understanding|Run downloaded malware or DDoS tools|
|**Medium (Organized Groups)**|Understand vulnerabilities and create targeted attacks|Cybercrime groups or hacktivists|
|**High (Advanced Persistent Threats / Nation-State Actors)**|Custom tools, zero-day exploits, long-term stealth operations|State-sponsored hacking teams|

### 🧩 Summary

|**Attribute**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Internal vs External**|Determines if the attacker is inside or outside the organization|Insider theft vs external hack|
|**Resources & Funding**|Influences scale and frequency of attacks|Single hacker vs government-backed team|
|**Sophistication & Capability**|Defines technical skill level and stealth|Script kiddie vs APT group|

### 🛡️ Key Takeaways

- Understanding **who** the threat actor is and **how capable** they are is just as important as **why** they attack.
- High-funded, highly skilled actors (like APTs) pose the **greatest risk**.
- Internal actors can cause **major damage** despite lower sophistication, due to privileged access.
