### 🔍 Overview

Not every cyber attacker is highly trained or well-funded.  
At the **lowest end of the threat spectrum** are **unskilled attackers**, also known as **script kiddies**.  
Despite their lack of technical skill, they can still cause **real damage** using tools made by others.

### 🧒 Who Are Unskilled Attackers?

- **Definition:**  
    Individuals with **limited technical knowledge** who rely on **ready-made hacking tools, scripts, or programs** developed by others.
- **Nickname:** _Script Kiddies_
- **Skill Level:** Very low — they often **don’t understand how the tools work**, nor can they **modify or create** their own.
### ⚔️ How They Attack

| **Attack Type**                          | **Description**                                                             | **Example Tool / Method**                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** | Flooding a network or website with excessive traffic to make it unavailable | Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)                             |
| **Website Defacement**                   | Changing a website’s content to display messages or graffiti                | Pre-made website defacement scripts                     |
| **Malware Spreading**                    | Using simple malware or scripts to infect devices                           | Copying existing viruses or Trojans from online sources |

💡 _Even simple attacks can cause downtime, reputational damage, or financial loss — especially if systems are unpatched._

### 💬 Motivation

| **Motivation**                            | **Description**                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧨 **Recognition / Notoriety**            | To gain fame among peers or online communities.                                                         |
| 🎢 **Thrill / Fun**                       | For excitement or curiosity — “Can I do it?”                                                            |
| 🧩 **Curiosity / Learning**               | Exploring systems to understand how they work.                                                          |
| 🚫 **Not Usually for Profit or Politics** | Unlike hacktivists or cybercriminals, script kiddies rarely have strong financial or ideological goals. |

### 🎯 Common Traits

|**Trait**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|🔹 **Low skill level**|Uses pre-built tools; lacks coding or exploit development knowledge.|
|🔹 **Limited resources**|Typically one person using personal hardware and internet.|
|🔹 **Opportunistic**|Targets easy or vulnerable systems rather than high-value ones.|
|🔹 **Large in number**|Many unskilled attackers = widespread nuisance threat.|


### ⚠️ Risk to Organizations
Even though individual script kiddies are low risk, **large groups** of them can:
- Overwhelm systems (through coordinated DDoS attacks)
- Damage brand reputation (via defacements)
- Exploit unpatched vulnerabilities  
    ➡️ Especially dangerous for organizations with **weak cybersecurity posture**.
---

### 🛡️ Key Takeaways
- **Script Kiddies = Low skill + High disruption potential**
- Use **publicly available hacking tools** without understanding them.
- Motivated by **recognition, curiosity, or mischief**, not money or politics.
- **Easier to defend against** with proper patching, monitoring, and DDoS protection.
- When **many act together**, even unskilled attackers can cause **serious network disruptions**.
