## **5. Types of Threat Actors**

1. **Unskilled Attackers:** Limited technical knowledge; use scripts or exploits.
2. **Hacktivists:** Motivated by political, social, or environmental causes.
3. **Organized Crime:** Structured groups targeting financial gain (ransomware, identity theft).
4. **Nation-state Actors:** Government-sponsored; perform espionage, sabotage, or cyber warfare.
5. **Insider Threats:** Employees who misuse access due to revenge, carelessness, or negligence.

## **6. Shadow IT**

- IT systems, devices, software, applications, or services used without organizational approval.
- Can pose security risks.
## **7. Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces**

- **Message-based attacks**
- **Image-based attacks**
- **File-based attacks**
- **Voice calls**
- **Removable devices**
- **Unsecured networks**

## **8. Deception & Disruption Technologies**

- **Honeypots:** Decoy systems to attract attackers and study techniques.
- **Honeynets:** Network of decoy systems for observing complex attacks.
- **Honeyfiles:** Decoy files to detect unauthorized access.
- **Honeytokens:** Fake data (e.g., credentials) that trigger alerts when accessed.

## **9. Key Takeaways**

- Understanding Threat Actors is essential for effective cybersecurity.
- Knowing motivations and attributes helps design targeted defenses.
- Shadow IT and attack surfaces expand potential vulnerabilities.
- Deception tools (honeypots, honeyfiles) help detect and mislead attackers.
