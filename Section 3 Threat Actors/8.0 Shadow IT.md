### **Definition**

**Shadow IT** refers to the use of **information technology systems, devices, software, applications, or services** without the **explicit approval or knowledge** of an organization’s IT department.  
Also known as **Stealth IT** or **Client IT**.

### **Forms of Shadow IT**
- **Hardware:** Personal monitors, USB drives, external hard drives, network adapters, etc.
- **Software:** Unapproved applications, plugins, or browser extensions.
- **Cloud services:** Dropbox, Google Drive, or other storage/collaboration tools used without approval.
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** Personal smartphones, tablets, or laptops used for work purposes.
### **Reasons Shadow IT Exists**
1. **Security or IT processes too strict/slow:** Employees bypass slow approval processes to get work done.
    - Example: Waiting 45 days for IT to approve and install a second monitor.
2. **Efficiency and convenience:** Users install tools or apps that improve workflow or productivity.
3. **Cloud adoption and mobility:** Rise of cloud services, mobile apps, and BYOD increases shadow IT.
4. **Innovation:** Employees attempt to solve problems on their own using unsanctioned tools.

### **Risks of Shadow IT**
- **Data breaches and leaks:** Unsanctioned tools may expose sensitive data.
- **Non-compliance:** Violation of industry regulations or company policies.
- **Malware infections:** Unknown software may contain malware.
- **Network management challenges:** Lack of standardization complicates troubleshooting and IT support.
- **System disruptions:** Unsupported devices or apps may interfere with corporate systems.
### **Examples**
- **Personal devices** connecting to corporate network without proper security controls.
- **Cloud storage** (Dropbox/Google Drive) used for sensitive work documents without IT oversight.
- **Browser extensions or plugins** installed to improve workflow but introducing security vulnerabilities.
### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Develop clear shadow IT policies:** Define what is allowed and what requires approval.
- **Balance flexibility and security:** Allow tools that improve productivity while maintaining compliance.
- **Implement BYOD security controls:** Require personal devices to meet minimum security standards.
- **Regular monitoring and audits:** Detect and manage unapproved devices, apps, and services.
- **User education:** Train employees about the risks and responsibilities associated with shadow IT.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Shadow IT is **unsanctioned IT use** within an organization.
- It can **increase innovation and efficiency**, but also introduces **significant security risks**.
- **Awareness, policies, and monitoring** are essential to managing shadow IT effectively.
- If the IT department is unaware of a system, device, or service, **it cannot secure it**, making shadow IT a hidden threat to enterprise networks.
