### **Definition**

**Insider threats** are cybersecurity risks originating from **within an organization**, involving individuals who have **legitimate access** to systems or data.  
These individuals can include:

- Current or former **employees**
- **Contractors**
- **Business associates**

Unlike external attackers, insiders have **intimate knowledge** of the organization’s infrastructure, making them potentially **more damaging**.

### **Key Characteristics**

- **Access-based risk:** Level of damage depends on access privileges.
- **Knowledge-based risk:** Technical skill or system familiarity amplifies threat potential.
- Can be **intentional** (malicious) or **unintentional** (careless/ignorant).
- Can facilitate **external attacks** (e.g., malware, backdoors).
### **Types of Insider Threats**

1. **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information for financial gain or competitive advantage.
2. **Sabotage:** Damaging systems or operations due to revenge or grievance.
3. **Privilege Misuse:** Exploiting access rights beyond intended use.
4. **Accidental Threats:** Human error, negligence, or lack of cybersecurity awareness (e.g., falling for phishing emails).

### **Motivations**

- **Financial gain:** Selling sensitive data or intellectual property.
- **Revenge/Grievance:** Harm due to perceived wrongs.
- **Ideological/Whistleblowing:** Exposing information for ethical or political reasons.
- **Negligence:** Carelessness or unawareness of security best practices.
### **Case Studies**

1. **Edward Snowden (2013):**
    - NSA contractor who leaked classified surveillance information.
    - Exploited **legitimate access** and deep system knowledge.
    - Caused massive damage to intelligence capabilities and U.S. national security.
2. **Twitter Hack (2020):**
    - Attack involved collaboration with **two insiders**.
    - High-profile accounts (Elon Musk, Obama, Biden) were compromised.
    - Used to execute a **Bitcoin scam**, showing insider threats can impact even tech-savvy organizations.
### **Impact**
- Can cause **financial loss, reputational damage, operational disruption, or national security compromise**.
- Cost estimates for insider-related incidents can reach **billions** depending on scale and severity.

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Assume no user is automatically trusted.
- **Robust Access Controls:** Limit privileges to only what is necessary.
- **Regular Audits & Monitoring:** Detect unusual activity promptly.
- **Employee Security Awareness:** Train staff on phishing, social engineering, and safe practices.
- **Separation of Duties:** Reduce risk by dividing responsibilities among multiple people.

### **Summary**
- An insider threat is the risk posed by trusted individuals **misusing their access**, either maliciously or accidentally.  
- Effective mitigation requires **technical controls, monitoring, and user education**, emphasizing that **cybersecurity is not just about defending against outsiders**.
