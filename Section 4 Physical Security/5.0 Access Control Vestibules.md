## What is an Access Control Vestibule?

An **access control vestibule** is a double-door system designed as one of the most effective physical security measures used by large organizations.

**Key Features:**

- Two electronically controlled doors
- Only one door can be opened at a time
- Creates a controlled intermediate space for identity verification
- Prevents unauthorized entry while validating credentials

## How Access Control Vestibules Work

1. **Entry Process:**
    - Person approaches and enters the outer door
    - Outer door locks behind them (trapping them in intermediate space)
    - Creates separation between untrusted (outside) and trusted (inside) areas
    - Identity/credentials must be verified before inner door opens
2. **Verification Outcomes:**
    - **Successful:** Inner door opens, person granted access to secured area
    - **Unsuccessful:** Person remains in vestibule until security personnel intervene

## Preventing Unauthorized Access

### Piggybacking
- **Definition:** Two people working together where an authorized person intentionally allows an unauthorized person to enter
- **Method:** Often involves social engineering or manipulation
- **Example:** Attacker dressed as delivery driver asks employee to swipe badge (50% success rate mentioned)
- **Key characteristic:** Involves complicity or negligence of authorized individual

### Tailgating
- **Definition:** Unauthorized person closely follows authorized person through access control without their knowledge or consent
- **Method:** Covert and opportunistic
- **Example:** Sneaking through turnstile right after someone swipes their card
- **Key characteristic:** Done without authorized person's knowledge

### Prevention
Access control vestibules help prevent both by being sized for only one person at a time, making it physically difficult to piggyback or tailgate.

## Access Badges

### Technology Types
- **RFID** (Radio Frequency Identification)
- **NFC** (Near-Field Communication)
- **Magnetic strips** (older, legacy technology)

### How They Work
1. Employee presents badge to reader (slide or hold near reader)
2. Badge provides detailed information about the person
3. System cross-references identity with centralized database
4. Access granted or denied based on permissions

### Key Features
- **Role-based access:** Can be programmed for different access levels based on job role
- **Audit trail:** Every badge use is logged, creating reviewable records
- **Swift process:** Takes only a few seconds per person
- **Multi-level security:** Can require separate badge access for individual offices within a building

### Real-World Example

At the National Security Agency:
- Access badges used on nearly every office door
- Top-secret clearance for building entry through lobby vestibule
- Individual offices had separate badge readers for second-level verification
- Access granted based on specific job role (e.g., cyber-defense vs. foreign language translation)

## Security Guards

Security guards stationed at access control vestibules provide three critical functions:

1. **Visual Deterrent**
    - Presence alone deters potential threats
2. **Verification Assistance**
    - Help when electronic badging systems fail
    - Check visitor identity and issue temporary badges
    - Follow organizational policies for visitor access
3. **Immediate Response Capability**
    - Can respond immediately to security breaches
    - Determine whether to confront intruders
    - Initiate emergency response protocols when needed

## Multi-Layered Security Approach

Access control vestibules work best when integrated with:
- Electronic access badges
- Security personnel
- Comprehensive security policies

This multi-layered approach ensures:
- Each component complements the others
- Potential vulnerabilities are minimized
- Facilities remain secure and accessible only to authorized personnel

## Key Takeaways
- Access control vestibules create a controlled environment for screening, identification, and verification
- The double-door system with electronic controls is the core security feature
- Human elements (security guards) remain essential despite technological advances
- Systems must be continually refined as threats evolve
- Proper implementation prevents both piggybacking and tailgating
- Audit trails from badge usage support security investigations
