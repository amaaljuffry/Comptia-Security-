# Door Locks - Physical Security Control

## Overview

**Door locks** are physical security controls designed to secure entryways by restricting and regulating access to particular spaces or property. They act as a primary barrier against unauthorized intrusions, ensuring only individuals with the appropriate key, code, or access method can gain entry.

### Critical Security Point
All perimeter security becomes useless once someone enters your building. Door locks are essential for:
- Protecting sensitive offices and data rooms
- Securing server rooms and network closets
- Controlling access to classified information areas
- Creating multiple layers of internal security

## The Vulnerability of Basic Locks

### Padlocks
- Use basic pin and tumbler systems
- **Can be picked in 15 seconds or less** by skilled attackers
- Not recommended for securing sensitive equipment or information
- Common but inadequate for network closets, filing cabinets

### Simple Door Locks
**Bedroom/Bathroom Style:**
- Defeated by inserting a long slender rod or needle into the hole
- Extremely weak security

**Flat Slot Style:**
- Can be unlocked with a flathead screwdriver or coin
- Provides minimal protection

### Traditional Key Locks
- More complicated than padlocks
- Still defeatable in **30-60 seconds** by skilled attackers
- Common on residential front doors
- Insufficient for high-security environments

## Modern Electronic Door Locks

### 1. Personal Identification Number (PIN) Systems
**Features:**
- Use multi-digit codes (commonly 8 digits)
- 8-digit PIN = 1 in 100 million chance of random guess
- Each person can have unique PIN
- Enables logging and auditing of access
- Tracks who accessed and when

**Example Use Case:**
Recording studio with 8-digit PIN for instructor access

### 2. Wireless Signal-Based Locks

**Technologies Used:**
- **NFC (Near Field Communication)** - Tap smartphone to unlock
- **WiFi** - Network-based access control
- **Bluetooth** - Short-range wireless unlocking
- **RFID** - Radio frequency identification badges

**Example:**
Smartphone unlocking front door via NFC tap

### 3. Biometric Locks

**Common Biometric Types:**
- **Fingerprint scanners** - Most common implementation
- **Retinal scanners** - High-security environments
- **Facial recognition** - Measures distances between facial features
- **Voice recognition** - Less common but available

**Classification:**
Biometrics are an **inherence factor** ("something you are") in authentication

**Advantages:**
- Unique to each individual
- Can log each entry/exit for auditing
- Cannot be easily shared or stolen
- No keys or codes to remember

## Biometric Authentication in Modern Devices

### Mobile Devices
**Touch ID (iPhone 5S - iPhone 8):**
- Fingerprint-based authentication
- Index finger or thumb sensor

**Face ID (iPhone X and newer):**
- Front-facing camera facial scan
- Measures distances between facial features
- Automatic authentication when holding phone

### Integration with Access Control
- Retinal scanners for high-security facilities
- Fingerprint readers at access control vestibules
- Combined with PINs for multi-factor authentication

## Biometric System Performance Metrics

### False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
**Definition:** Rate that the system authenticates an unauthorized user as valid

**Problem:**
- Allows unauthorized access
- Security breach risk
- Should be minimized to zero

**Example:**
Wrong person's fingerprint accepted as yours

### False Rejection Rate (FRR)
**Definition:** Rate that the system denies an authorized user who should have access

**Problem:**
- Prevents legitimate users from accessing systems
- Creates operational inefficiencies
- Users cannot perform their jobs

**Example:**
Authorized person's fingerprint rejected 50% of the time

### Sensitivity Trade-off
- **High sensitivity** → Lower FAR but Higher FRR
- **Low sensitivity** → Higher FAR but Lower FRR
- Need balance between security and usability

### *Crossover Error Rate (CER) / Equal Error Rate (EER)*

**Definition:** The point where False Acceptance Rate equals False Rejection Rate

**Importance:**
- Primary measure of biometric system effectiveness
- Used for comparing different biometric systems
- **Lower CER = Better system performance**

**Decision Making:**
When purchasing biometric locks, always check the CER - the lower, the better

## Multi-Factor Authentication with Door Locks

### Combining Authentication Factors

**Example 1: Server Room Access**
- 8-digit PIN (something you know)
- Fingerprint (something you are)
- = Two-factor authentication

**Example 2: Office Building Access Control Vestibule**
- Electronic badge (something you have)
- PIN number (something you know)
- = Two-factor authentication

### Access Control Vestibule Design

**Typical Setup:**
1. Open lobby (public access)
2. Turnstiles with badge readers
3. PIN entry required
4. Area between front door and turnstiles = access control vestibule
5. Secure area beyond turnstiles

**Authentication Process:**
- Scan badge at turnstile
- Enter PIN
- Multi-factor authentication validates authorization
- Access granted to secure area

## Cipher Locks

### Description
Older mechanical locking mechanism with numbered push buttons requiring correct combination entry

### Characteristics
- **Mechanical** (not electronic)
- Numbered push buttons
- Combination-based access
- No electronic components needed

### Common Uses
- Server rooms
- Network closets
- High-security locations
- Buildings with sensitive areas

### Advantages
- Higher protection than traditional locks
- No power required (mechanical)
- More expensive but more secure
- Reliable and durable

**Example:**
Dion Training offices use 8-digit mechanical cipher lock on front door

## Key Takeaways

### Vulnerability Timeline
**Perimeter security measures include:**
- Electrified fences with barbed wire
- Steel/cement bollards
- Surveillance cameras
- Roving security guards
- Access control vestibules
- Armed lobby security

**Critical Moment:**
All these become useless once someone enters the building - door locks are the next defense layer

### Security Hierarchy (Weakest to Strongest)

1. **Padlocks** - 15 seconds to pick
2. **Simple door locks** - Seconds with basic tools
3. **Traditional key locks** - 30-60 seconds to pick
4. **PIN-based electronic locks** - Better security with logging
5. **Wireless/RFID locks** - Convenient with tracking
6. **Biometric locks** - Strongest individual authentication
7. **Multi-factor systems** - Best security (combines 2+ factors)
8. **Cipher locks** - Reliable mechanical high-security option

### Best Practices

**For Sensitive Areas:**
- Use electronic or biometric locks
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Enable logging and auditing
- Regular access review and updates

**System Selection:**
- Check Crossover Error Rate (CER) for biometric systems
- Consider operational needs vs. security requirements
- Balance convenience with protection level
- Plan for backup access methods

**Remember:**
Door locks serve as primary defense mechanisms once perimeter security is breached. Not all locks are equal - choose based on the sensitivity of the area being protected.
