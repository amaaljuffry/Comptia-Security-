### 🔍 **1. Overview**

Before diving into technical topics (like SQL injection, password cracking, or firewalls), cybersecurity professionals must first understand **core principles** that shape all security decisions.

Security work is difficult because:

- 🧨 There are **external threats** (hackers, malware, data theft).
- ⚙️ There are **internal threats** (users bypassing controls for convenience).
- ⚖️ There’s always a **trade-off between security and usability**.

### ⚖️ **2. Security vs. Usability Trade-Off**

|Aspect|Example|Risk|
|---|---|---|
|**High Security**|Long complex Wi-Fi password like `3%1WT&!92#SXH`|Hard to remember, users might write it down (risk exposure).|
|**High Usability**|Simple password like `cupcake#1`|Easier to use, but easier to hack.|

🔸 **Key Insight:**  
The more **convenient** a system is, the **less secure** it tends to be — and vice versa.  
Cybersecurity professionals must find the **“sweet spot”** between both.

💸 _In 2022, the average cost of a data breach was $4.35 million per company._

### 🧠 **3. Core Security Definitions**

#### **Information Security**

> Protecting the **data and information** from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.  
> **Focus:** The _data_ itself.  
> **Example:** Encrypting files, protecting customer records.

#### **Information System Security**

> Protecting the **systems** that store, process, or transmit data.  
> **Focus:** The _devices or infrastructure_.  
> **Example:** Securing servers, networks, or smartphones.

### 🧩 **4. The C.I.A. Triad**

|Element|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Confidentiality**|Ensures only authorized users can access data.|Encrypting sensitive files.|
|**Integrity**|Ensures data is accurate and unaltered.|Using checksums or hashes.|
|**Availability**|Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.|Using redundancy or backup systems.|

✅ **Goal:** Maintain balance between all three — protect data, keep it accurate, and ensure it’s available to the right people.

### 🪶 **5. Additional Security Concepts**

#### **Non-Repudiation**

> Guarantees that a specific action or event **cannot be denied** by the person who performed it.  
> **Example:** A digitally signed email ensures proof of sender identity.

#### **Authentication (added to the triad)**

> Verifying **who a user or system is** before granting access.

🔹 With these two additions, the traditional **C.I.A. Triad** becomes **C.I.A.N.A**:  
**C**onfidentiality – **I**ntegrity – **A**vailability – **N**on-Repudiation – **A**uthentication  
→ Represented as a **Pentagon of Security** 🔺

### 🔐 **6. The AAA of Security**

|Term|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Authentication**|Verifies identity of a user or system.|Logging in with username + password.|
|**Authorization**|Determines what actions or data the user can access.|Employee can view, but not edit, customer data.|
|**Accounting (Auditing)**|Tracks and records user activities for auditing or billing.|Logging login times, commands, and access attempts.|

### 🧰 **7. Security Controls**

Security controls are **measures used to protect** the C.I.A.N.A principles and mitigate risk.

#### **Categories of Security Controls**

|Category|Focus|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Technical**|Hardware/software-based mechanisms.|Firewalls, encryption, antivirus.|
|**Managerial**|Administrative and procedural safeguards.|Policies, training, risk assessments.|
|**Operational**|Day-to-day security processes.|Incident response, user access management.|
|**Physical**|Tangible barriers and safeguards.|Locks, cameras, guards.|

#### **Types of Security Controls**

|Type|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Preventive**|Stop incidents before they occur.|Firewalls, strong passwords.|
|**Deterrent**|Discourage potential attackers.|Warning signs, policy enforcement.|
|**Detective**|Identify incidents as they happen.|IDS, monitoring systems.|
|**Corrective**|Restore systems after an incident.|Backups, patches.|
|**Compensating**|Provide alternate control if main one fails.|Manual monitoring if IDS is offline.|
|**Directive**|Define expected behavior.|Security policies, standard operating procedures.|

### 🧱 **8. Zero Trust Security Model**

> **Principle:** “Never trust, always verify.”

No one — internal or external — is trusted by default.  
Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated.

#### **Zero Trust Architecture Layers**

|Plane|Focus|Components|
|---|---|---|
|**Control Plane**|Policies and trust decisions|Adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, secure zones.|
|**Data Plane**|Enforcement of those policies|Policy engine, policy administrator, enforcement points.|

### 🧩 **9. Summary of Key Concepts**

|Concept|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Security vs. Usability**|Balancing user convenience and system protection.|
|**Information Security**|Protecting data itself.|
|**Information System Security**|Protecting the devices/systems that hold data.|
|**C.I.A.N.A**|Core security principles — Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-repudiation, Authentication.|
|**AAA**|Authentication, Authorization, Accounting — identity and activity control.|
|**Security Controls**|Safeguards used to prevent, detect, or respond to incidents.|
|**Zero Trust**|No implicit trust; continuous verification required.|

### 🧠 **Memory Tip**

> 🔐 “Security is a Balance — Protect the Data (C.I.A), Verify the User (AAA), and Trust No One (Zero Trust).”
