### 🔐 **Definition**

**Authorization** refers to the process of determining **what a user is allowed to do** after their identity has been verified (authenticated).  
It governs **permissions**, **privileges**, and **access levels** within a system or network.

> 🧠 In short:
> 
> - **Authentication:** Confirms _who you are._
> - **Authorization:** Determines _what you can do._

### 🏢 **Simple Analogy**

Imagine entering a **secure building**:

- Scanning your ID card at the entrance = **Authentication**
- Being allowed only on certain floors = **Authorization**

Similarly, in a digital environment:

- Logging into a system = Authentication
- Being able to view, edit, or delete data = Authorization

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of Authorization**

Authorization ensures:
1. **Protection of Sensitive Data**
2. **Maintenance of System Integrity**
3. **Streamlined User Experience**
### 1️⃣ **Protecting Sensitive Data**

Authorization restricts access to confidential data to only authorized individuals.  
Example:

- In a **hospital network**:
    - A **nurse** can view patient vitals.
    - A **doctor** can edit treatment plans.
    - A **patient** can view only parts of their own record.

This prevents exposure of private or classified information to unauthorized users.

### 2️⃣ **Maintaining System Integrity**

Authorization helps prevent accidental or malicious changes by limiting modification rights.  
Example:

- **All staff** may view financial reports.
- Only **accountants** can edit or approve financial transactions.

By assigning privileges carefully, systems stay stable and secure from internal misuse.

### 3️⃣ **Streamlining the User Experience**

By limiting what users can see or do, authorization makes interfaces simpler and reduces confusion.  
Example:

- **Students** see only lessons and quizzes.
- **Instructors** see editing tools, video uploads, and grading features.

This **role-based customization** improves both usability and security.
### ⚙️ **Types of Authorization Models**

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**|Access granted based on user’s **role** in the organization.|A “Manager” can approve leave requests, while “Employee” cannot.|
|**Rule-Based Access Control**|Access determined by a set of **rules or conditions**.|Only users from a specific IP range can log in.|
|**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**|Uses **attributes** (user, resource, environment) to decide access.|A user can access data _only during business hours_ from _company devices_.|

### 🔑 **Core Principle**

> **“Now that I know who you are, here’s what you’re allowed to do.”**

Authorization enforces boundaries and ensures users operate strictly within their intended scope — protecting systems, users, and organizations.

### 🧠 **Key Concept Links**

- **Authentication → Authorization → Accountability** (AAA Security Model)
- **Authorization ↔ Least Privilege** → Give only what’s necessary.
- **Authorization ↔ Access Control** → Policies that enforce permissions.

---

### 🏁 **Summary**

- **Authorization** defines _what_ actions authenticated users can perform.
- It **protects sensitive data**, **preserves system integrity**, and **simplifies user experience**.
- Implemented via **RBAC**, **Rule-Based**, or **ABAC** methods.
- Essential for ensuring that **only the right people access the right resources** for the right reasons.
