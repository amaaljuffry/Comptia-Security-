## 🛡️ **Non-Repudiation in Cybersecurity — Study Notes**

### 🔍 **Definition**

**Non-repudiation** is a security principle that ensures individuals or entities **cannot deny** their participation in a communication or transaction.

It provides **undeniable proof** of the origin and integrity of data — confirming that a message, transaction, or action **was indeed performed by the stated party**.

---

### 🧾 **Historical Analogy**

- **Before computers:** Kings and noblemen used **signet rings** to seal documents with wax.
    
    - The unique seal proved the message’s authenticity and sender identity.
    - The recipient couldn’t deny receiving or opening it.

🕰️ _→ Early form of non-repudiation._

---

### 💻 **Modern Equivalent**

- In the digital era, **digital signatures** replace the old signet seals.
- A **digital signature** is:
    1. Created by **hashing** a message or file.
    2. Then **encrypting the hash digest** with the sender’s **private key** (asymmetric encryption).

This ensures:

- The sender’s **identity** (authenticity).
- The message’s **integrity** (no tampering).
- The sender **cannot deny** having sent it.

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. Sender creates a **hash** of the message.
2. The hash is **encrypted with the sender’s private key**.
3. Receiver uses the sender’s **public key** to decrypt and verify:
    - If decryption succeeds → message came from that sender and hasn’t been altered.

### 🔐 **Key Benefits of Non-Repudiation**

|Benefit|Description|
|---|---|
|**1. Authenticity**|Confirms who sent the message or transaction (can’t fake private keys).|
|**2. Integrity**|Ensures message wasn’t modified in transit. Any change breaks the digital signature.|
|**3. Accountability**|Users are responsible for their digital actions — actions can be traced back to them.|

---

### 🧠 **Example Scenarios**

- **Email transactions:** Digitally signed emails prove the sender’s identity.
- **Stock trading:** Broker can verify a sell order was genuinely sent by the client.
- **Insurance app tracking:** Mobile app tied to user’s biometrics provides proof of who performed actions.

### 💬 **Key Analogy**

> Sending an unsigned email is like sending a letter without a return address.  
> Sending a digitally signed message is like sending a registered letter that the receiver must sign for.

### 🧩 **Core Concept Summary**

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Goal**|Prevent denial of actions or participation|
|**Mechanism**|Digital signatures (private + public key encryption)|
|**Ensures**|Authenticity, Integrity, Accountability|
|**Analogy**|King’s seal → Digital signature|

### 🏁 **Quick Memory Tip**

**“Non-repudiation = No Denial”**  
→ If it’s signed digitally, it’s undeniable proof.
