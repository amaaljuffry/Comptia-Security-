### 🧩 **Definition**

**Integrity** ensures that data remains **accurate, consistent, and unaltered** from its original state unless modified by an **authorized individual**.  
It verifies the **trustworthiness** of data throughout its **entire lifecycle** — from creation to storage and transmission.

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of Integrity**

Integrity is critical for:

1. **Data Accuracy** – Ensures data isn’t changed or corrupted.
2. **Trust Maintenance** – Builds user and system confidence.
3. **System Operability** – Prevents malfunction or downtime caused by corrupted data.

---

### 📘 **Examples**

- **Data Accuracy:** Preventing unauthorized edits to financial records or medical data.
- **Trust:** Users lose confidence if bank balances or transactions appear tampered.
- **System Operability:** Corrupted configuration files can crash systems.

### 🔒 **Five Key Methods to Maintain Integrity**

#### 1. **Hashing**

- Converts data into a **fixed-size hash value** (digest).
- Even a small data change alters the hash drastically.
- Acts as a **digital fingerprint** for verifying data integrity.
- ✅ Example: SHA-256 hash comparison for downloaded files.

#### 2. **Digital Signatures**

- Uses **encryption + hashing** to verify both **integrity** and **authenticity**.
- Steps:
    
    1. Data → Hashed
    2. Hash → Encrypted using private key
    3. Any alteration invalidates the signature.
- ✅ Example: Signing a document to confirm it hasn’t been tampered with.
    

#### 3. **Checksums**

- Used during **data transmission**.
- Sender and receiver compare checksum values.
- If values match → data intact  
    If values differ → data corrupted or altered.
- ✅ Example: File transfers (FTP, network packets).

#### 4. **Access Controls**

- Restrict **who can modify data**.
- Prevents **unintentional** or **malicious** changes.
- Enforced through permissions, roles, and authentication.
- ✅ Example: Only admins can modify critical configuration files.
#### 5. **Regular Audits**

- Routine **log reviews and inspections** to detect unauthorized changes.
- Helps identify configuration or data integrity issues early.
- ✅ Example: Scheduled audit of database access logs.

### 🧠 **Key Concept Links**

- **Integrity ↔ Hashing** → Hashing is the primary method to maintain data integrity.
- **Integrity Violations** can lead to:
    - Loss of trust
    - Inaccurate decisions
    - System failure

### 🏁 **Summary**

Integrity guarantees that:

- Data remains **consistent, accurate, and trustworthy**.
- Unauthorized or accidental modifications are **detectable**.
- Organizations maintain **trust and reliability** in digital operations.
