### 🔐 **Definition**

Security controls are **measures implemented to protect systems and data**.  
Each control type serves a **specific purpose** depending on the threat, vulnerability, or situation.

> 🧠 Key idea: Think of security controls as **treatments a doctor applies**, depending on the illness or stage.

### ⚡ **Six Basic Types of Security Controls**

#### 1️⃣ **Preventative Controls**

- **Definition:** Proactive measures to **prevent security incidents before they occur**.
- **Purpose:** Fortify systems against potential threats.
- **Examples:**
    - Firewalls
    - Antivirus software
    - Strong password policies
- **Key idea:** Stop attacks before they happen.

#### 2️⃣ **Deterrent Controls**

- **Definition:** Measures to **discourage potential attackers** by increasing perceived risk or effort.
- **Purpose:** Make attacks **less appealing or harder** to attempt.
- **Examples:**
    - Warning signs or banners
    - Security cameras (signage)
    - “This system is monitored” notifications
- **Key idea:** Psychological barrier to prevent attacks.

#### 3️⃣ **Detective Controls**

- **Definition:** Systems or mechanisms to **identify and alert organizations** to malicious or unauthorized activity.
- **Purpose:** Detect incidents **as they occur or shortly after**.
- **Examples:**
    
    - Security cameras (monitoring)
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
    - Log monitoring and alerts
- **Key idea:** Watchful eye to catch incidents.

#### 4️⃣ **Corrective Controls**

- **Definition:** Measures used to **mitigate damage and restore systems** after a security incident.
- **Purpose:** Repair and recover from threats.
- **Examples:**
    
    - Antivirus quarantining and removal of malware
    - System restore procedures
    - Patching vulnerabilities

- **Key idea:** Fix problems and reduce impact.

> ⚠️ Note: Some tools can act as both **detective and corrective controls** depending on usage.

#### 5️⃣ **Compensating Controls**

- **Definition:** Alternative measures when **primary controls are not feasible or effective**
- **Purpose:** Maintain security **despite limitations**.
- **Examples:**
    - Using VPN over WPA2 when WPA3 is not supported
    - Manual monitoring if automated tools are unavailable
- **Key idea:** Backup or mitigation when ideal controls cannot be applied.

---

#### 6️⃣ **Directive Controls**

- **Definition:** Policies, guidelines, or procedures that **mandate or guide actions**.
- **Purpose:** Ensure **proper behavior and standard practices**.
- **Examples:**
    
    - Acceptable Use Policies (AUP)
    - Security procedures documentation
    - Organizational rules and mandates
- **Key idea:** Rules and guidance for secure operations.

### 🧩 **Summary**

|Control Type|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Preventative|Stop threats before they occur|Firewall, antivirus|
|Deterrent|Discourage attackers|Warning signs, banners|
|Detective|Detect and alert|IDS, monitoring cameras|
|Corrective|Fix problems|Malware removal, system restore|
|Compensating|Alternative protection|VPN over WPA2, manual monitoring|
|Directive|Guide behavior|AUP, security policies|

> 🔑 **Key takeaway:** Effective cybersecurity requires **using a combination of these controls** to create a balanced and resilient security strategy.
