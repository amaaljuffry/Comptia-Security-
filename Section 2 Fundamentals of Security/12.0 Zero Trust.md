## **1. Introduction**

- Modern digital threats are increasingly sophisticated.
- Traditional perimeter-based defenses (firewalls, IDS, strong network walls) are no longer sufficient.
- Networks have become **deperimeterized** due to:
    
    - Cloud adoption
    - Remote work
    - Mobile and wireless technologies
    - Outsourcing and contracting

## **2. Concept of Zero Trust**

- **Zero Trust Principle:** _"Trust nothing, verify everything."_
- Unlike traditional networks, **no device, user, or transaction is trusted by default**.
- Verification is required for every access request, regardless of origin (inside or outside network).

## **3. Key Drivers for Zero Trust**

- Work is increasingly remote.
- Data and services are spread across multiple environments.
- Traditional castle-like network defenses are inadequate.
## **4. Zero Trust Architecture**

Zero Trust relies on **two planes**:
### **A. Control Plane**
- Defines, manages, and enforces access policies.
- **Key Components:**
    1. **Adaptive Identity** – User identities are dynamically validated based on behavior, device, location, etc.
    2. **Threat Scope Reduction** – Users only access resources necessary for their tasks; minimizes attack surface.
    3. **Policy-Driven Access Control** – Role-based policies dictate access; ensures only relevant data is accessible.
    4. **Secured Zones** – Isolated environments for sensitive data; access restricted to authorized users.
- **Policy Engine & Policy Administrator:**
    - Policy Engine: evaluates requests against rules.
    - Policy Administrator: manages and enforces policies in alignment with organizational objectives.
### **B. Data Plane**

- Ensures policies are executed.
- **Key Components:**
    1. **Subject or System** – Entity requesting access (employee, device, or application). Must be verified before access.
    2. **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** – Gatekeeper that grants or denies access based on policy evaluation.
## **5. Benefits of Zero Trust**

- Reduces risk from both external and internal threats.
- Limits blast radius in case of a breach.
- Ensures continuous verification for access to critical resources.
- Complements modern trends: remote work, cloud services, and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).
## **6. Key Takeaways**

- Traditional perimeter defenses still matter but cannot be relied on alone.
- Zero Trust transforms security into a **continuous, adaptive, verification-driven process**.
- Security decisions are made dynamically at each access request.
- Organizations adopting Zero Trust can build more resilient and adaptable security postures.
