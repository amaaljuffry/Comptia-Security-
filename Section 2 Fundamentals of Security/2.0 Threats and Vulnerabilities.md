### 🔹 1. Definition of Key Terms

#### **Threat**

- Anything that can cause **harm, loss, damage, or compromise** to IT systems.
- Usually comes from **external sources**.
- Examples:
    
    - Natural disasters (earthquake, flood)
    - Cyberattacks (malware, ransomware)
    - Data breaches or data leaks
    - Disclosure of confidential information

> ⚠️ We **cannot control** all threats — but we can **minimize their impact** through mitigation.

#### **Vulnerability**

- Any **weakness** in system design, implementation, or process that can be exploited.
- Comes from **internal factors**.
- Examples:
    - Software bugs
    - Misconfigured firewalls or routers
    - Missing security patches
    - Poor access control
    - Lack of physical security

> ✅ We **can control** vulnerabilities by identifying and mitigating them before attackers exploit them.

### 🔹 2. The Relationship Between Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Threat**|External factor that can cause damage|
|**Vulnerability**|Internal weakness that allows a threat to succeed|
|**Risk**|The **intersection** of a threat and vulnerability — when both exist together|

> 📍 **Formula:**  
> **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability**

- **If there’s a threat but no vulnerability → No risk.**
    
- **If there’s a vulnerability but no threat → No risk.**
### 🔹 3. Risk Management Decisions

Cybersecurity professionals deal with vulnerabilities by choosing one of four options:

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|**Mitigate**|Take action to reduce or eliminate risk (e.g., patching, firewall configuration)|
|**Transfer**|Shift the risk to another entity (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)|
|**Avoid**|Stop the risky activity altogether|
|**Accept**|Acknowledge the risk and decide to tolerate it (low-priority risk)|

### 🔹 4. Real-Life Example: Getting to Work on Time

#### **Vulnerabilities (Internal Factors)**

- Forgot to fill car with fuel → _Preparation vulnerability_
- Forgot to drop kids off at school → _Scheduling vulnerability_
- Skipped car maintenance → _Vehicular vulnerability_
#### **Threats (External Factors)**

- Traffic accident caused by another driver
- Natural disaster destroying the road

> ⚖️ **Risk occurs** when both a threat and vulnerability exist — e.g., you forgot to fuel the car (_vulnerability_) and there’s traffic (_threat_).


### 🔹 5. Applying Risk Mitigation

To **reduce risk**, you can:

- Wake up an hour earlier → Adds buffer time (mitigation)
- Plan alternative routes → Contingency planning
- Check weather/traffic reports → Early detection
This everyday scenario mirrors **cyber risk management**.

### 🔹 6. Cybersecurity Risk Management Analogy

|Everyday Example|Cybersecurity Equivalent|
|---|---|
|Waking up early|Adding redundancy or backup|
|Checking traffic|Network monitoring|
|Servicing car|System maintenance & patching|
|Buying car insurance|Cyber insurance|
|Avoiding bad roads|Avoiding risky system configurations|

### 🔹 7. Goal of Risk Management in Cybersecurity

As cybersecurity professionals, our objectives are to:

- Maintain **continuity of services**
- Ensure **system security and stability**
- **Prevent data breaches** by minimizing vulnerabilities
- Use proper **mitigation strategies** to reduce impact when risks are realized

           |     Vulnerabilities     | (Internal)
           +-------------------------+
                       ↓
                = RISK (Impact)
```

### 🏁 **Key Takeaways**

- **Threats** = external dangers
- **Vulnerabilities** = internal weaknesses
- **Risk** = intersection of the two
- **Goal:** Mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept risks
- **Cybersecurity = Risk Management**
