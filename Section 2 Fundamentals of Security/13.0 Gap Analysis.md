# **Gap Analysis: Study Notes**

## **1. Definition**
- **Gap Analysis**: A process for evaluating the differences between an organization’s **current performance** and its **desired performance**.
- **Purpose**: Identify areas for improvement to bridge the gap and achieve organizational goals.
- Useful for improving operations, processes, performance, or cybersecurity posture.

## **2. Steps in Conducting a Gap Analysis**
1. **Define Scope**
    - Identify specific areas of the organization to be evaluated.
    - Clarify the desired outcomes of the analysis.
2. **Gather Data**
    - Collect information on the current state using surveys, interviews, or other methods.
3. **Analyze Data**
    - Compare current performance against desired performance.
    - Identify gaps where the organization falls short.
4. **Develop a Plan to Bridge Gaps**
    - Implement changes to processes, systems, or practices.
    - Set **specific goals, objectives, and timelines** for improvement.
## **3. Example: Cloud Migration**
- Evaluate current on-premise security (firewalls, IDS, access controls).
- Compare with cloud security standards (AWS, Azure).
- Identify gaps:
    - Outdated encryption methods
    - Incompatible access control policies (IAM)
- Plan updates to encryption and IAM policies for secure migration.

## **4. Types of Gap Analysis**
1. **Technical Gap Analysis**
    - Focuses on infrastructure and technical capabilities.
    - Example: Network not supporting data encryption or zero trust architecture.
2. **Business Gap Analysis**
    - Focuses on business processes and operational capabilities.
    - Example: Inefficient data management, budgeting, or forecasting processes.

## **5. Real-World Example**

- Weekly **vulnerability assessments** conducted to find software vulnerabilities, weak encryption, and outdated configurations.
- Findings prioritized and addressed using a **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)**:
    - Allocate resources
    - Set timelines
    - Fix high-priority vulnerabilities first

- Helps move from **current state → desired security state**.

## **6. Key Takeaways**

- Gap analysis is a powerful tool for continuous improvement.
- Identifies weaknesses in technical systems and business processes.
- Provides actionable steps for bridging gaps.
- Essential for cloud migration, vulnerability management, and enhancing security posture.
- Ensures a structured plan to reach desired organizational performance.
