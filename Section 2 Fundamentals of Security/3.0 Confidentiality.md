## 🧠 Confidentiality**

### 🔹 1. Definition

**Confidentiality** = Protecting information from **unauthorized access and disclosure.**

- Ensures **private or sensitive information** is only available to authorized individuals, entities, or processes.
- Core concept of the **CIA Triad**:  
    **C**onfidentiality – **I**ntegrity – **A**vailability

> 🎯 **Goal:** Keep information secret and safe from unauthorized users while allowing legitimate access.

### 🔹 2. Real-World Example

> Imagine a bank leaves **loan applications** on a counter for anyone to see.  
> Each contains names, addresses, SSNs, and income details.  
> → This violates **confidentiality** because unauthorized people can view sensitive data.

### 🔹 3. Why Confidentiality Is Important

|Purpose|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Protect Personal Privacy**|Prevent personal data (health, finance, etc.) from being exposed or shared without consent.|Protecting medical or tax records|
|**Maintain Business Advantage**|Keep proprietary information, strategies, and customer data secret to stay competitive.|Secret product designs or client lists|
|**Regulatory Compliance**|Meet laws requiring protection of personal data (GDPR, HIPAA, PDPA).|Avoid fines and legal penalties|

### 🔹 4. Five Key Methods to Ensure Confidentiality

#### 1️⃣ **Encryption**

- Converts plaintext into ciphertext to prevent unauthorized reading.
- Requires a **decryption key** to restore the data.
- Even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable.

> 💡 _Think: Confidentiality = Encryption_

---

#### 2️⃣ **Access Controls**

- Restrict access to authorized users through permissions or credentials.
- Implemented via:
    - Password-protected files
    - Role-based access (RBAC)
    - Authentication systems (username/password, MFA)

> 🧱 Example: Only HR can open employee salary files.

#### 3️⃣ **Data Masking**

- Hides or replaces parts of sensitive data to prevent full exposure.
- Keeps data useful for authorized users.

> 💳 Example: Credit card numbers displayed as `**** **** **** 1234`.


#### 4️⃣ **Physical Security Measures**

- Protects physical and digital data from theft or damage.
- Includes:
    - Locked filing cabinets
    - Security cameras
    - Biometric door locks
    - Controlled server room access

> 🔒 Protects both _paper records_ and _digital storage systems_.


#### 5️⃣ **Training & Awareness**

- Human error causes many confidentiality breaches.
- Conduct regular **security awareness training** to prevent:
    - Accidental disclosures
    - Phishing incidents
    - Social engineering attacks

> 👥 Educate employees on handling sensitive information safely.

### 🔹 5. Common Threats to Confidentiality

|Threat|Example|
|---|---|
|**Unauthorized access**|Hacker breaks into a database|
|**Social engineering**|Phishing to trick users into revealing passwords|
|**Insider misuse**|Employee leaks confidential files|
|**Physical theft**|Stolen laptops or paper documents|

### 🔹 6. Linking Concepts

|Concept|Relation to Confidentiality|
|---|---|
|**Encryption**|Primary method to ensure confidentiality|
|**Authentication**|Ensures only legitimate users gain access|
|**Least Privilege Principle**|Users only get minimum access needed|
|**Data Classification**|Helps determine what data needs protection|
