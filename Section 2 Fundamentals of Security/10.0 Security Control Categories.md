### 🔐 **Definition**

Security controls are **safeguards or countermeasures** implemented to **reduce risks and protect organizational assets**.  
They are **layered across multiple categories** to provide a comprehensive security posture.

> 🧠 Key idea: Security = _Technology + Strategy + Procedures + Physical Measures_

### 🏰 **Castle Analogy**

|Element|Cybersecurity Equivalent|
|---|---|
|Castle walls|Technical controls (firewalls, antivirus)|
|Watchtowers|Physical controls (surveillance, locks)|
|Guards with plans|Operational controls (procedures, daily practices)|
|Leader of city watch|Managerial controls (strategy, governance)|

### ⚙️ **Four Categories of Security Controls**

#### 1️⃣ **Technical Controls**

- **Definition:** Technologies, hardware, or software that **automatically manage and reduce risk**.
- **Purpose:** Protect system **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.
- **Examples:**
    - Firewalls
    - Antivirus software
    - Encryption
    - Intrusion detection systems
- **Key idea:** Automated tools and mechanisms.
---

#### 2️⃣ **Managerial Controls** _(Administrative Controls)_

- **Definition:** Strategic and governance measures to **align security with organizational goals**.
- **Purpose:** Ensure **risk management, policies, and planning** are effective.
- **Examples:**
    - Security policies
    - Risk assessments
    - Training programs
    - Incident response strategies
- **Key idea:** Decision-making and planning to guide security posture.
    

---

#### 3️⃣ **Operational Controls**

- **Definition:** Procedures and measures executed **day-to-day** by people to protect data and systems.
- **Purpose:** Maintain **ongoing security and reduce human errors**.
- **Examples:**
    
    - Password rotation (e.g., every 90 days)
    - Backup procedures
    - Account reviews
    - User awareness training
- **Key idea:** Human-driven, routine security practices.
    

---

#### 4️⃣ **Physical Controls**

- **Definition:** Tangible, real-world measures to **protect assets from physical threats**.
- **Purpose:** Prevent unauthorized **physical access** to systems and sensitive data.
- **Examples:**
    
    - Biometric scanner
    - Surveillance cameras
    - Locked doors
    - Security guards
    - Secure shredding of documents
- **Key idea:** Physical barriers to protect assets and facilities.

### 🧩 **Summary**

- Effective cybersecurity requires a **layered approach** combining all four categories:
    
    1. **Technical** – Automated protection tools
    2. **Managerial** – Strategy and policies
    3. **Operational** – Day-to-day procedures
    4. **Physical** – Tangible defenses
- Each category complements the others, forming a **robust and resilient security posture**.
- **Analogy:** Just like a castle relies on walls, guards, watchtowers, and leadership, an organization relies on technical, operational, managerial, and physical controls.
