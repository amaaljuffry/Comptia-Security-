### **Data Classifications Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept & Purpose**

*   **What is Data Classification?**
    *   The process of categorizing data based on its **value to the organization** and the **sensitivity** of the information if it were to be disclosed.
*   **Who Decides?**
    *   The **Data Owner** is responsible for determining the classification level.
*   **Why Classify Data?**
    *   **To Apply Proportional Security:** Not all data requires the same level of protection. Classification allows an organization to:
        *   Allocate more **resources (money, time, personnel)** to protect high-sensitivity data.
        *   Apply stricter **access controls and technical solutions** to highly classified data.
    *   **Prevent Over-classification:** Labeling too much data as highly classified is costly and inefficient. Proper classification ensures security spending is smart and effective.

#### **2. Commercial Business Classification Scheme**

*(From lowest to highest sensitivity)*

| Classification | Impact of Disclosure | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public** | **No impact** on the organization. | Information on public websites, marketing brochures, this course. |
| **Sensitive** | **Minimal impact**. Could provide a slight advantage to competitors. | Organization's financial data, upcoming product plans. |
| **Private** | **Significant impact**. Internal data about individuals or the company. | Personal employee records, salary information, internal revenue data. (Note: Relates to an individual entity). |
| **Confidential** | **Serious effect** on the business. severely restricted access. | Trade secrets, intellectual property (IP), source code, exam questions. Often requires an NDA. |
| **Critical** | **Too valuable for any risk.** Viewing is **severely restricted** to a few trusted individuals. | Credit card numbers, other data whose loss would be catastrophic. |

#### **3. Military/Government Classification Scheme**

*(From lowest to highest sensitivity)*

| Classification | Impact of Disclosure | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unclassified** | No risk to national security. Can be released to the public. | Data subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). |
| **Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU)** | Would **not** hurt national security, but would impact individuals. | Medical records, personal files of service members. |
| **Confidential** | Could **seriously affect** the government. | Trade secrets. |
| **Secret** | Could **seriously damage** national security. | Military deployment plans, defensive postures. |
| **Top Secret** | Could **gravely damage** national security. | Blueprints for weapon systems. |

#### **4. Data Lifecycle & Retention**

*   Data should not be stored forever. A formal policy is required to manage its entire lifecycle.
* COLLECT, RETAIN, DISPOSE
*   **The Policy Must Define:**
    *   **How** data is stored.
    *   **When** it is stored.
    *   **How long** it is retained (the retention period).
    *   **How** it is securely destroyed/disposed of when no longer needed.
*   **Legal Compliance:**
    *   Retention periods are often dictated by **local, state, and federal laws and regulations** (e.g., financial or medical data). Organizations must be aware of and comply with these requirements.

### **Key Takeaways & Mnemonics**

*   **Who Decides?** The **Data Owner**.
*   **Why Classify?** To implement **cost-effective, proportional security** and avoid the pitfalls of **over-classification**.
*   **Commercial vs. Government:** Know the two different classification schemes. The government scheme is more familiar from movies and news (Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret).
*   **Impact Language:**
    *   **Commercial:** Minimal Impact -> Serious Effect -> Too Valuable for Risk.
    *   **Government:** Seriously Affect -> Seriously Damage -> Gravely Damage.
*   **Lifecycle Matters:** Data has a lifespan. Have a policy for **retention and secure disposal** that complies with the law.
