### **Securing Data: Methods & Techniques 

#### **1. Core Concept: A Layered Approach**

Data security requires a combination of techniques tailored to an organization's specific needs and the nature of its data. No single method is sufficient on its own.

#### **2. Data Security Methods**

| Method | Description | Primary Use Case / Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Geographic Restrictions (Geofencing)** | Setting up virtual boundaries to restrict data access based on geographic location. | - Complying with **data sovereignty laws**.<br>- Blocking login attempts from high-risk countries where no employees are located. |
| **Encryption** | Transforms readable data (**plaintext**) into unreadable data (**ciphertext**) using an algorithm and a key. | - Protecting **data at rest** (full-disk encryption).<br>- Protecting **data in transit** (TLS/SSL). |
| **Hashing** | A **one-way** function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters (a **hash value**). **It cannot be reversed.** | - Verifying **data integrity** (file checksums).<br>- Storing **passwords** securely. |
| **Masking** | Replacing some or all of the data in a field with a placeholder (e.g., `XXX-XX-1234` for a SSN). **It is a one-way process (de-identification).** | - Displaying data in UIs for support agents.<br>- Using production data for development/testing without exposing real values. |
| **Tokenization** | Replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive substitute (**token**). The original data is stored in a secure, separate database. | - **Payment processing** to protect credit card numbers.<br>- The token can be used in systems without exposing the real data. |
| **Obfuscation** | Making data unclear or unintelligible to unauthorized users. This is a **broad category** that can include encryption, masking, and pseudonyms. | - General term for making data hard to understand without being authorized. |
| **Segmentation** | Dividing a network into separate segments (subnets), each with its own security controls. | - **Containing breaches**: If an attacker compromises one segment, they cannot easily move laterally to others.<br>- Also known as **network segmentation**. |
| **Permission Restrictions** | Defining **who** has access to data and **what** they can do with it (read, write, delete). | - Implemented via **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.<br>- Enforces the **principle of least privilege**. |

### **Key Comparisons & Clarifications**

*   **Encryption vs. Hashing:**
    *   **Encryption:** Two-way process (can be decrypted with the key). Used for **confidentiality**.
    *   **Hashing:** One-way process (cannot be reversed). Used for **integrity** and password storage.

*   **Masking vs. Tokenization:**
    *   **Masking:** The original data is **obscured and cannot be retrieved**. Used for de-identification.
    *   **Tokenization:** The original data is **stored securely elsewhere** and can be retrieved by authorized systems using the token.

*   **Obfuscation:** This is a **goal** (to make data unclear) achieved by several other methods, including masking and encryption.

### **Key Takeaways & Mnemonics**

*   **For Confidentiality:** **Encryption** and **Tokenization**.
*   **For Integrity:** **Hashing**.
*   **For Access Control:** **Permission Restrictions** and **Segmentation**.
*   **For Compliance:** **Geographic Restrictions** (sovereignty) and **Masking** (privacy).
*   **Containment Strategy:** **Segmentation** limits the "blast radius" of a security breach.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Enforced through **Permission Restrictions** (RBAC/ACLs).
