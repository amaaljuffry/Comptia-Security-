### **Study Notes: Cryptographic Attacks**

#### **1. Introduction to Cryptographic Attacks**
*   **Definition:** Techniques used by adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.
*   **Goal:** To compromise the **confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity** of data.
*   **Methods:** Can target weak algorithms, flawed software implementations, or use brute force.
*   **Focus of this Lesson:** Downgrade attacks, Collision attacks, and the threat of Quantum Computing.

### **2. Downgrade Attack (Version Rollback Attack)**

*   **What it is:** An attack that forces a system to abandon a modern, secure protocol and use a weaker, older one instead.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  During the initial "handshake," two systems negotiate which cryptographic protocol to use (e.g., TLS 1.3 vs. SSL 3.0).
    2.  An attacker (Eve) intercepts this communication.
    3.  Eve **manipulates the messages** to make it appear that the highest version both systems support is an old, vulnerable one.
    4.  The systems, unaware of the manipulation, proceed with the weak protocol.
*   **Why it's Dangerous:** It exploits **backward compatibility**, turning a feature (support for older systems) into a vulnerability.

#### **Real-World Example: The POODLE Attack**
*   **Stands for:** Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption.
*   **Target:** Forced systems to use the insecure **SSL 3.0** instead of TLS.
*   **Result:** Allowed attackers to extract sensitive data from encrypted sessions.

#### **Countermeasures:**
*   **Phasing out** support for known-insecure legacy protocols.
*   **Version intolerance checks:** A system initially claims to only support the latest version. If a downgrade is forced, it becomes obvious an attacker is interfering.

### **3. Collision Attack**

*   **What it is:** An attack that aims to find **two different input messages** that produce the **exact same hash output**.
*   **Why it's a Problem:** Hashes are used for data integrity (e.g., file verification). If two different files have the same hash, an attacker can substitute a malicious file that appears to be legitimate.

#### **The Birthday Paradox / Birthday Attack**
*   **Concept:** In a group of just 23 people, there's a >50% chance two share a birthday. This counterintuitive probability applies to hashing.
*   **Application to Cryptography:** Finding a collision in a hash function is much more probable than it seems due to the mathematics of probability. This is why hash functions need a large output size.

#### **Real-World Example: MD5**
*   The MD5 hashing algorithm was once popular but is now **considered broken** due to proven vulnerabilities that make collision attacks feasible.
*   **Impact:** Allows for forging digital signatures, impersonating trusted entities, and distributing tampered data.

### **4. Quantum Computing & The Cryptographic Threat**

#### **What is Quantum Computing?**

*  **Meaning** = A computer that uses quantum mechanics to generate and manipulate quantum bits (qubits) in order to access enormous processing powers.
* **Quantum Communication** = A communications network that relies on qubits made of photons (light) to send multiple combinations of ones and zeros simultaneously which results in tamper resistant and extremely fast communications.
* **Core Unit:** Uses **Qubits (Quantum Bits)**, not traditional bits (1s and 0s).
*   **Key Property: Superposition** - A qubit can represent multiple combinations of 1 and 0 simultaneously.
*   **Use Case:** Not for general-purpose computing. Excellent for solving **very complex math problems** (e.g., atomic modeling, breaking cryptography).

#### **The Threat to Cryptography**
*   **The Problem:** Modern **asymmetric encryption** (like RSA & ECC) relies on "hard" math problems (e.g., factoring large prime numbers).
*   **Quantum Advantage:** Quantum computers can solve these problems **exponentially faster** than classical computers, rendering current asymmetric encryption vulnerable.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Now:** No operational quantum computers exist; they are in the prototyping phase.
    *   **Future Estimate:** Governments/large corporations may have them by ~2030; consumer availability not until ~2040s.

#### **Post-Quantum Cryptography (The Solution)**
The development of new cryptographic algorithms that can run on today's computers but are resistant to attacks from future quantum computers.

**Two Main Approaches:**
1.  **Increase Key Sizes:** For **symmetric encryption** (like AES), moving from AES-128 to AES-256 significantly increases the number of combinations a quantum computer must check.
2.  **Develop New Algorithms:** Creating new **asymmetric algorithms** based on math problems that are hard for both classical and quantum computers.

#### **NIST's Post-Quantum Standards (Selected in 2022)**
*   **For General Encryption:** **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (Based on lattice-based cryptography).
*   **For Digital Signatures:** **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** (primary recommendation), **FALCON**, or **SPHINCS+**.
