#### **Core Concept**
**Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography):** A system that uses **two mathematically linked keys**:
*   **Public Key:** Freely shared with everyone.
*   **Private Key:** Kept secret by the owner.

**Fundamental Rule:**
*   Data encrypted with the **public key** can only be decrypted with the corresponding **private key**.
*   Data encrypted with the **private key** can only be decrypted with the corresponding **public key**.

### **How Asymmetric Encryption Provides Security Services**

| Security Service | How It's Achieved | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidentiality** | Encrypt the data with the **receiver's public key**. | Only the receiver, with their private key, can decrypt and read it. |
| **Authentication & Non-Repudiation** | Encrypt a message (or a hash of it) with the **sender's private key**. This creates a **digital signature**. | The receiver uses the sender's public key to verify the signature. This proves the sender's identity (non-repudiation). |
| **Integrity** | Often combined with non-repudiation by creating a **hash** of the message and signing *that* with the private key. | Any change to the message in transit will invalidate the hash, proving a lack of integrity. |

**The Combined Process (for an email):**
To get **Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Non-Repudiation** simultaneously:
1.  Sender creates a **hash** of the message.
2.  Sender encrypts the hash with their **private key** (this is the **digital signature**), providing **Integrity, Authentication, and Non-Repudiation**.
3.  Sender encrypts the *entire package* (message + digital signature) with the **receiver's public key**, providing **Confidentiality**.

### **Key Asymmetric Algorithms**

#### **1. Diffie-Hellman**
*   **Primary Use:** **Key Exchange.** Used to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
*   **Common Application:** Setting up **VPN tunnels** (e.g., in IPSec).
*   **Important Note:** It is **susceptible to man-in-the-middle (on-path) attacks** if not combined with an authentication method (like passwords or digital certificates).
*   **Remember:** Diffie-Hellman is for **key exchange**, not for encrypting data directly.

#### **2. RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)**
*   **Primary Uses:** **Key Exchange, Encryption, and Digital Signatures.**
*   **Basis:** Relies on the mathematical difficulty of **factoring large prime numbers**.
*   **Key Size:** 1024 to 4096 bits.
*   **Common Example:** The rotating codes on **hardware tokens** for multi-factor authentication are often based on RSA.

#### **3. ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**
*   **Primary Use:** **Encryption** (especially for low-power devices).
*   **Basis:** Uses the algebraic structure of **elliptic curves**.
*   **Key Advantage:** **Extremely efficient.** Provides the same level of security as RSA with a much smaller key size (e.g., a **256-bit ECC key** is as strong as a **2048-bit RSA key**).
*   **Common Application:** **Mobile devices, tablets, and smart cards** where processing power and battery life are limited.

#### **ECC Variants:**
*   **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman):** The ECC version of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
*   **ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral):** Uses temporary keys for each session, providing **Perfect Forward Secrecy**.
*   **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):** Used for **digital signatures**. It is the standard used by the US government for digital signatures.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

| Algorithm | Primary Use | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diffie-Hellman** | **Key Exchange** | Foundational protocol for securely sharing a secret to set up VPNs. |
| **RSA** | Encryption, Key Exchange, Digital Signatures | The classic, widely-used algorithm. Relies on factoring primes. |
| **ECC** | Encryption (for mobile/low-power) | **High efficiency.** Strong security with smaller keys than RSA. |

**Remember:**
*   **Public Key = Confidentiality.** Encrypt with the receiver's public key.
*   **Private Key = Non-Repudiation/Signatures.** Sign with the sender's private key.
*   **Diffie-Hellman** is for agreeing on a key, not for sending messages.
*   **RSA** is the well-known, versatile workhorse.
*   **ECC** is the modern, efficient choice for mobile and embedded systems.
