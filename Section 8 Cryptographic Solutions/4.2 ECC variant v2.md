what is ECC?

**Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** is a family of algorithms based on **elliptic curves** that provide strong encryption, key exchange, and digital signatures — all with smaller key sizes and faster performance compared to older methods like RSA or traditional Diffie–Hellman.

ECC can be used for:

- **Key exchange** (securely sharing encryption keys),
- **Encryption**, and
- **Digital signatures** (authenticating messages).

## ⚙️ Now, the three main ECC variants

### 1️⃣ **ECDH — Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman**

> 🔐 Used for **secure key exchange** between two parties.

- Based on the traditional **Diffie–Hellman key exchange**, but uses elliptic curve math.
- Two people (say Alice and Bob) each have their own ECC key pair:
    - Alice: (private_A, public_A)
    - Bob: (private_B, public_B)
- They exchange their **public keys**, and each computes a **shared secret** using:
    
    ```
    shared_secret = private_A × public_B = private_B × public_A
    ```
    
- Both end up with the same secret value, which can be used to derive a symmetric encryption key (e.g., for AES).
    

✅ **Used in:** Secure communications (TLS, VPNs, SSH, etc.)  
❌ **Does not provide authentication** — only key exchange.

### 2️⃣ **ECDHE — Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral**

> 🔁 Used for **temporary (session-based) key exchange** with **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).**

- “Ephemeral” = temporary.  
    Each time a session starts, a **new random key pair** is generated, used once, and then thrown away.
- Even if a hacker later steals the server’s private key, **past communications remain secure**, because every session used a unique key.

✅ **Provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** — a huge security upgrade.  
✅ Common in HTTPS/TLS (`TLS_ECDHE_RSA` or `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA` cipher suites).  
❌ Slightly more computational work (because keys are regenerated each time).


### 3️⃣ **ECDSA — Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm**

> ✍️ Used for **signing messages or verifying identities** (not for key exchange).

- The ECC version of the **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**.
- Provides **authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation**.
- Uses your **private key to sign** and **public key to verify**.
- The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approves ECDSA as a **federal standard** for digital signatures.
✅ Used in:

- **Bitcoin & Ethereum** (signing transactions)
- **TLS certificates**
- **Code signing** and **identity verification**

## 🧩 Summary Table

|Variant|Full Name|Main Purpose|Generates|Provides|Common Use|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**ECDH**|Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman|Secure key exchange|Shared secret key|Confidentiality|VPNs, TLS|
|**ECDHE**|Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral|Temporary key exchange|Session key|Perfect Forward Secrecy|HTTPS, TLS 1.3|
|**ECDSA**|Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|Digital signature|Signature (r,s)|Authentication, Integrity|Blockchain, Certificates|

✅ **In short:**

- **ECDH** → share secret key
- **ECDHE** → share secret key _with temporary session security_
- **ECDSA** → prove who you are (signatures)
