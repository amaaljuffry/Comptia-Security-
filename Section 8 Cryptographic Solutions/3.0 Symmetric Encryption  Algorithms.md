#### **Core Concept**
**Symmetric Encryption:** A method where the **same key** is used for both **encryption and decryption**.

### **Detailed Algorithm Breakdown**

#### **1. DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
*   **Key Size:** 64-bit key, but only **56-bits are effective** (8 bits for parity).
*   **Block Size:** 64-bit blocks.
*   **Process:** Data is put through **16 rounds** of transposition and substitution.
*   **Status:** **Weak and obsolete.** Used from the 1970s to early 2000s. Not secure against modern computing power.

#### **2. 3DES (Triple DES)**
*   **Key Size:** Effectively uses **three 56-bit keys** (effective strength of 112 bits).
*   **Process:** An enhancement of DES. Data is put through the DES algorithm **three times**: **Encrypt** (Key 1) -> **Decrypt** (Key 2) -> **Encrypt** (Key 3).
*   **Status:** Stronger than DES, but now considered **largely deprecated** and being phased out.

#### **3. IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)**
*   **Key Size:** 128-bit key.
*   **Block Size:** 64-bit blocks.
*   **Status:** Stronger than DES, but not widely adopted. Known for its use in **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**.

#### **4. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - The Gold Standard**
*   **Key Sizes:** 128-bit, 192-bit, or **256-bit** keys.
*   **Other Names:** Also known as the **Rijndael** algorithm.
*   **Status:** The **winner of the NIST contest** to replace DES. It is the **most widely used** symmetric algorithm and the **de facto standard**.
    *   Used by the US government for sensitive (unclassified) data.
    *   Considered the **strongest** of the symmetric algorithms covered.

#### **5. Blowfish & Twofish** (open source product)
*   **Blowfish:**
    *   **Key Size:** 32-bit to 448-bit key.
    *   **Block Size:** 64-bit blocks.
    *   Developed as a DES replacement but not widely adopted.
*   **Twofish:**
    *   **Key Size:** 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys.
    *   **Block Size:** 128-bit blocks.
*   **Status:** Both were released as **open-source** and were entrants in the NIST contest that AES won.

#### **6. Rivest Ciphers (RC Suite)**
Created by Ron Rivest. RC1, RC2, and RC3 were never published or were broken.

*   **RC4:**
    *   **Type:** **Stream Cipher** (the only one in this list).
    *   **Key Size:** Variable, from 40 to 2048 bits.
    *   **Usage:** Was used in **SSL** and **WEP** (now considered insecure in these contexts).
*   **RC5:** A **block cipher** with key sizes up to 2048 bits.
*   **RC6:** A stronger, advanced version of **RC5**. It was a finalist in the NIST contest that AES won.

| Algorithm | Type | Key Size | Status & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DES** | Block | 56-bit effective | **Obsolete.** Weak. |
| **3DES** | Block | 112-bit effective | **Deprecated.** Phasing out. |
| **IDEA** | Block | 128-bit | Used in PGP. Not widely adopted. |
| **AES** | Block | 128, 192, 256-bit | **Gold Standard.** Most common & strongest. |
| **Blowfish** | Block | 32-448 bit | Open source. Not widely used. |
| **Twofish** | Block | 128, 192, 256-bit | Open source. AES contest finalist. |
| **RC4** | **Stream** | 40-2048 bit | **Insecure** in WEP/SSL. The only stream cipher here. |
| **RC5/RC6** | Block | Up to 2048 bit | RC6 was an AES contest finalist. |

**Remember:**
*   You do **not** need to memorize all key/block sizes, but understand that **larger key sizes generally mean stronger encryption**.
*   **AES** is the most important algorithm to know. It is the modern standard for symmetric encryption.
*   **RC4** is the notable **stream cipher** in this group; all others are block ciphers.
