### **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - Study Notes**

#### **1. Core Concept of PKI**
*   **Definition:** PKI is an **entire system** of hardware, software, policies, procedures, and people that is based on **asymmetric encryption**.
*   **Common Example:** Connecting to a website using **HTTPS** is a common use of PKI.
*   **PKI vs. Public Key Cryptography:**
    *   **Public Key Cryptography:** Refers specifically to the **encryption and decryption process** using public/private keys. It is just *one part* of PKI.
    *   **PKI:** The **broader framework** that creates, manages, distributes, and validates the digital keys and certificates.

#### **2. How PKI Works: The HTTPS Example**

The goal is to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a web browser and a server.

**Step 1: Initiating the Connection**
*   A user enters `https://www.example.com` into their browser.
*   The browser contacts a **Certificate Authority (CA)** to get the website's **public key**.

**Step 2: Establishing a Shared Secret (Asymmetric Encryption)**
1.  The browser generates a random string to use as a **shared secret key** for symmetric encryption (e.g., AES).
2.  The browser **encrypts this shared secret** using the website's **public key**.
3.  The encrypted secret is sent to the web server.
4.  The web server **decrypts the secret** using its **private key** (the only one that can decrypt it).

**Step 3: Switching to Secure Communication (Symmetric Encryption)**
*   Both the browser and the server now know the shared secret key.
*   They switch to using **symmetric encryption** (e.g., AES) within a **TLS/SSL tunnel** for all further communication.

**Outcomes of this Process:**
*   **Confidentiality:** The symmetric tunnel ensures data is encrypted and private.
*   **Authentication:** The browser can trust the server's identity because only the legitimate server possesses the private key that decrypted the shared secret.

#### **3. Key Components of PKI**

##### **A. Certificate Authority (CA)**
*   **Role:** A **trusted third party** that issues and manages **digital certificates**.
*   **Function:** Acts as the root of trust. When your browser trusts a CA, it automatically trusts the certificates it issues.

##### **B. Digital Certificates**
*   **Purpose:** Acts as a digital ID card, binding a public key to an identity (e.g., a website, person, or device).
*   **Contents:** Typically includes the owner's public key, identifying information, the issuing CA, and a digital signature.

##### **C. Key Escrow**
*   **Definition:** The process of storing cryptographic keys with a **secure, trusted third party** (the escrow agent).
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Data Recovery:** To prevent data loss if an employee leaves or loses their private key.
    *   **Legal Access:** For legal investigations where access to encrypted data is required.
*   **Controversy & Security Concern:**
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures encrypted data is never permanently inaccessible.
    *   **Risk:** If the escrow is compromised, a malicious actor can decrypt vast amounts of data. Therefore, access must be **heavily regulated** and storage must be **extremely secure**.

### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

| Concept | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** | The **entire system** (policies, software, people) for managing keys and certificates. | Enables secure communication, authentication, and data exchange over networks. |
| **Public Key Cryptography** | The **method** of using a public/private key pair for encryption/decryption. | A **component** of PKI used to securely establish a shared secret. |
| **Certificate Authority (CA)** | A **trusted third party** that issues digital certificates. | Provides the foundation of **trust** in the PKI system. |
| **Key Escrow** | **Storing keys** with a secure third-party service. | Provides **data recovery** and legal access, but introduces a **security risk**. |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Used with public/private keys to **securely exchange a shared secret**. | Establishes the initial secure connection. |
| **Symmetric Encryption** | Uses a single shared secret key for **bulk data encryption**. | Provides efficient and fast **confidentiality** for the ongoing session. |

**The Big Picture:** PKI is the foundational framework that makes secure internet communication (like HTTPS) possible. It combines asymmetric and symmetric encryption to provide **confidentiality, authentication, and integrity**.
