# 1.0 Cryptography Solution

## What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography** is the practice of writing and solving codes in order to hide the true meaning of information.

Most commonly, cryptography is used as a form of **encryption**.

### Encryption Basics

**Encryption** is the process of converting ordinary information (plaintext data) into an unintelligible format (ciphertext data).

- **Plaintext**: Original, readable data
- **Ciphertext**: Encrypted, unreadable data
- **Key**: Required to decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext

## Data States and Protection

Data exists in one of three states at any given time:

### 1. Data at Rest
- Inactive data that's been archived
- Data resident on hard drives or storage devices
- Data sitting as files

### 2. Data in Transit
- Data moving across the network
- Data residing in computer memory (RAM)
- Data moving to/from processor and storage devices

### 3. Data in Use
- Data undergoing constant state of change
- Data inside processor with active calculations being performed

**All three states can be protected through encryption.**

## ROT13 Cipher Example

### What is ROT13?
- Stands for "Rotate 13 spots"
- Simple substitution cipher
- Each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet

### Example Process:
- Letter **C** + 13 positions = **P**
- Letter **R** + 13 positions = **E** (wraps around alphabet)
- Encrypted message: "Pelcgbtencul vf sha"
- Decrypted message: "Cryptography is fun"

### Key Concepts:
- **Algorithm**: The rotation method (ROT13)
- **Key**: The number 13 (how many positions to rotate)
- **Encryption**: Add 13 positions
- **Decryption**: Subtract 13 positions

## Ciphers and Algorithms

### Cipher
A cipher is simply an **algorithm** that performs encryption or decryption functions.

### Algorithm
A **mathematical function** that:
- Takes input data
- Performs mathematical transformations
- Outputs scrambled/encrypted values

## The Importance of Keys

### Critical Principle:
**All encryption strength comes from the KEY, not the algorithm.**

### Why?
- Most algorithms undergo public review
- Algorithm code is openly accessible
- Security doesn't rely on keeping the algorithm secret
- The key determines the cipher's output

### Key Definition:
The essential piece of information that determines the output of the cipher.

## Key Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Long, Strong Keys
- Key length is **directly proportional** to security level
- Longer keys = more secure, more resistant to brute force attacks

### Examples:
- **128-bit key**: Secure for most applications
- **256-bit key**: Much higher protection, exponentially harder to break
- Moving from 128 to 256 bits = **exponential** increase (not just double)

### 2. Regular Key Rotation
Keys can become vulnerable over time due to:
- Technology advances
- Prolonged exposure (years of use)
- Increased probability of being guessed

**Best Practice**: Regularly change cryptographic keys

### Key Rotation Examples:
- Many organizations rotate TLS keys **annually**
- Some cloud providers auto-rotate keys every **90 days**

**Benefit**: Combining appropriate key lengths with consistent rotation significantly enhances cryptographic defenses.

## Open-Source Algorithms

### Important Facts:
- Most/all encryption algorithms today are **open-source and publicly accessible**
- Algorithms are designed to be **transparent**
- Strength comes from **rigorous peer reviews**, not obfuscation
- **Security through obscurity** is unreliable and insecure

### Security Reality:
✅ Trust algorithms due to transparency and peer review
❌ Security depends on **secrecy of encryption keys**

### Key Protection Requirements:
If keys are compromised, the entire system's security crumbles—regardless of algorithm robustness.

### Key Safeguarding Measures:
1. Store in **secure hardware modules**
2. **Encrypt keys** when at rest
3. **Transmit securely** when in use
4. **Strictly limit access** to authorized personnel only
5. Conduct **regular audits and monitoring**
6. Monitor for **unauthorized access attempts**
