### **Study Notes: Understanding Digital Certificates**

#### **1. What is a Digital Certificate?**
*   A **digital certificate** (or public key certificate) is a digital file that binds a public key to the identity of its owner (like a website, person, or organization).
*   It is used to establish the **authenticity and legitimacy** of a website, especially when connecting over **HTTPS (port 443)**.
*   You can view it by clicking the **lock icon** next to a website's URL in the browser.

#### **2. Key Components of a Digital Certificate**
A certificate contains several critical pieces of information:

*   **Subject:** The entity the certificate was issued **to**.
    *   Example: `Google LLC`, `Apple Inc.`
*   **Issuer:** The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued and digitally signed the certificate.
    *   Example: `Google Trust Services`, `DigiCert`
*   **Validity Period:** The start and end dates for which the certificate is valid.
*   **Public Key Info:** The core public key and the algorithm used.
    *   **Public Key:** The actual cryptographic key.
    *   **Signature Algorithm:** The hash function used for integrity (e.g., `SHA-256`).
    *   **Public Key Algorithm:** The type of cryptography (e.g., `RSA` or `ECC`).

#### **3. Two Common Public Key Algorithms**

| Feature | **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** | **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Size** | Larger (e.g., **2048 bits** or more) | Smaller (e.g., **256 bits**) |
| **Processing Power** | Requires more computational power | Requires less computational power |
| **Common Use Case** | **Desktop** environments with more resources | **Mobile/Low-power** devices for efficiency |
| **Security Efficiency** | Provides strong security with a larger key | Provides **equivalent security** with a much smaller key |

**Key Takeaway:** ECC achieves the same level of security as RSA with a significantly smaller key size, making it more efficient.

#### **4. Demonstration Summary: Google vs. Apple**

| Aspect | **Google (www.google.com)** | **Apple (www.apple.com)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Issued To** | Google LLC, Mountain View, CA | Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA |
| **Issued By** | Google Trust Services | DigiCert |
| **Signature Hash** | SHA-256 | SHA-256 |
| **Public Key Algorithm** | **ECC (Elliptic Curve)** | **RSA** |
| **Key Size** | 256 bits | 2048 bits |
| **Inferred Reason** | Optimized for **mobile browsers** and minimalism. | Serving the **desktop version** of the site. |

#### **5. Why the Difference in Algorithms?**
*   The choice of algorithm is often a strategic decision by the website based on the **user's device**.
*   **Mobile-First (Google):** Uses ECC to provide strong security while conserving battery life and processing resources on phones and tablets.
*   **Desktop (Apple in this case):** Uses RSA because desktop computers have ample processing power to handle the larger key sizes efficiently.

#### **6. Other Certificate Details**
*   Certificates also contain unique identifiers like:
    *   **Serial Number**
    *   **Key ID**
    *   **Thumbprint/Fingerprint:** A unique hash that acts as a fingerprint for that specific certificate.

### **Glossary of Key Terms**
*   **HTTPS:** The secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS encryption.
*   **Certificate Authority (CA):** A trusted entity that issues and verifies digital certificates (e.g., DigiCert, Google Trust Services).
*   **Public Key:** The publicly shareable part of a cryptographic key pair used for encryption and verification.
*   **SHA-256:** A secure hash algorithm used for creating a unique, fixed-size digital fingerprint of data.
