# 7.0 Conducting an Anti-Phishing Campaign

## Overview
Anti-phishing campaigns test users' ability to recognize and avoid phishing scams. These simulated attacks help organizations identify vulnerabilities in their human defenses and provide targeted remedial training to those who fall victim.

## Purpose of Anti-Phishing Campaigns

### Objectives:
1. **Test user awareness** - Measure effectiveness of security training
2. **Identify vulnerable users** - Find who needs additional training
3. **Provide remedial training** - Educate those who click malicious links
4. **Measure improvement** - Track progress over time
5. **Build security culture** - Reinforce safe practices

### Benefits:
- Realistic practice without actual risk
- Immediate feedback for users
- Measurable security metrics
- Targeted training opportunities
- Reduced risk of real attacks

## Creating a Phishing Campaign

### Step 1: Create Campaign
1. Log into Phish Insight account
2. Click "Create a Campaign"
3. Define campaign parameters

### Step 2: Define Target Recipients
**Create recipient list with user information:**

**Required Information:**
- **List name** - Campaign identifier (e.g., "Jason")
- **First name** - User's first name
- **Last name** - User's last name
- **Email address** - Target email (e.g., jason@diontraining.com)
- **Department/Title** - User's role (e.g., "Instructor")

**Example Entry:**
- First name: Jason
- Last name: Dion
- Email: jason@diontraining.com
- Title: Instructor

**Scale Considerations:**
- **Small campaign:** Single user or small team
- **Medium campaign:** Department or division
- **Large campaign:** Hundreds or thousands of employees

### Step 3: Select Template
**Choose pre-built phishing email template**

**Example: LinkedIn Connection Request**

**Why This Template Works:**
- Common, expected communication
- People receive these frequently
- Users don't think twice about clicking
- Realistic and familiar format
- High success rate

**Template Content:**
```
Subject: Jason, please add me to your LinkedIn network

Body:
Hi Jason Dion,

I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.

[Accept Button]
[View Profile Button]
[Update Settings]
[Unsubscribe]
```

**Template Features:**
- Personalized with recipient name
- Professional appearance
- LinkedIn branding and logo
- Realistic formatting
- Multiple clickable elements

**Customization Options:**
- Modify template text
- Change branding
- Adjust difficulty level
- Add or remove indicators
- Create custom templates

### Step 4: Configure Sender Information
**Set up email sender details**

**Example Configuration:**
- **From:** invitations@linkedin.com
- **Display Name:** Invitations

**Intentional Red Flags (Testing Mode):**
- **Misspelling 1:** "LinkedIn" spelled as "Linkein" (missing 'd')
- **Misspelling 2:** "Invitations" spelled incorrectly

**Purpose of Errors:**
- Test if users notice details
- Identify who pays attention to sender addresses
- Measure awareness levels

**Realistic Mode:**
- Use correct spelling: invitations@linkedin.com
- Perfect replication of legitimate emails
- Tests users without obvious clues
- More challenging assessment

**Strategy Decision:**
Choose based on training goals:
- **With errors:** Easier test, measures basic awareness
- **Without errors:** Harder test, measures true vigilance

### Step 5: Schedule Campaign
**Determine campaign timing and duration**

**Scheduling Options:**

**1. Single Event:**
- One-time email send
- All users receive at once
- Quick assessment
- Good for small groups

**2. Staggered Schedule:**
- Spread over days/weeks/months
- Multiple waves of testing
- Measure learning over time
- Good for large organizations
- Reduces suspicion

**3. Recurring Campaigns:**
- Regular testing intervals
- Ongoing awareness measurement
- Continuous improvement tracking
- Best for enterprise environments

**Benefits of Scheduling:**
- Avoid overwhelming security team
- Allow time for remedial training
- Track improvement between waves
- Natural appearance (not all at once)

### Step 6: Configure Response Actions
**Determine what happens when user clicks link**

**Training Timing Options:**

**1. When Campaign Ends:**
- Collect all results first
- Provide training to all failed users together
- Delayed feedback
- Good for group training sessions

**2. When Phished (Immediate):**
- User gets instant feedback
- Immediate learning opportunity
- Reinforces consequences
- Higher impact on behavior

**Example Response Page:**
```
⚠️ You've Been Phished!

This was a simulated phishing attack to test your security awareness.

What happened:
- You clicked on a malicious link
- In a real attack, malware could have been installed
- Your credentials could have been stolen

What you should have done:
- Hover over links before clicking
- Verify sender email address
- Open new browser and visit site directly

```

**Notification Options:**
- Text message alerts (for administrators)
- Email notifications
- Dashboard updates
- Real-time tracking

### Step 7: Launch Campaign
**Start the phishing simulation**

**Final Steps:**
1. Review all settings
2. Confirm recipient list
3. Verify template and sender info
4. Set schedule and response actions
5. Click "Start Campaign"

**Typical Timeline:**
- Campaign activates in ~1 hour
- Users begin receiving emails
- Tracking starts immediately
- Results populate in real-time

## Anatomy of a Phishing Email

### Example: LinkedIn Connection Request

**What User Sees:**

**Subject Line:** "Jason, please add me to your LinkedIn network"

**From:** Invitations (display name)

**Email Body:**
- LinkedIn logo (authentic appearance)
- Professional formatting
- Personalized greeting: "Hi Jason Dion"
- Multiple clickable elements:
  - [Accept] button
  - [View Profile] link
  - [Change frequency] link
  - [Unsubscribe] link

**Visual Appearance:**
- Looks completely legitimate
- Professional design
- Familiar branding
- Realistic layout
- Well-crafted content

### Hidden Dangers (URL Analysis)

**What Appears vs. Reality:**

**Visual Text:** "Accept" or "View Profile"
**Actual Link:** websitefun.club

**Detection Method:**
**Hover over each link to reveal actual destination**


**Link Analysis:**
| **Button/Link** | **Displays As** | **Actually Goes To** |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Accept | linkedin.com (implied) | websitefun.club |
| View Profile | linkedin.com/profile | websitefun.club/profile |
| Change Frequency | linkedin.com/settings | websitefun.club/settings |

**Key Observation:**
- All links redirect to non-LinkedIn domain
- Classic phishing indicator
- Domain doesn't match brand
- Would be obvious upon hovering

## Training Users: Correct Response

### What Users Should NOT Do:
❌ Click on links in the email
❌ Trust email appearance alone
❌ Assume familiar branding means legitimate
❌ Act on email requests directly
❌ Enter credentials on linked pages

### What Users SHOULD Do:
✅ **Open new web browser**
✅ **Manually navigate to known legitimate site** (linkedin.com)
✅ **Check notifications on actual site**
✅ **Accept/reject requests through verified platform**
✅ **Report suspicious email to security team**

### Correct Workflow Example:

**Step 1:** Receive LinkedIn connection request email
**Step 2:** Do NOT click any links in email
**Step 3:** Open new browser window
**Step 4:** Type "linkedin.com" directly in address bar
**Step 5:** Log in to LinkedIn normally
**Step 6:** Check notifications/connection requests there
**Step 7:** Accept or reject request on actual LinkedIn site

### Why This Approach Works:
- Uses known, verified URL
- Bypasses potential phishing links
- Protects credentials
- Prevents malware installation
- Maintains control of navigation


## Risks of Clicking Phishing Links

### Potential Consequences:

**1. Malware Installation**
- Drive-by downloads
- Ransomware
- Keyloggers

- Account compromise
- Identity theft

**3. Information Collection**
- Browser fingerprinting

- System information gathering
- Network reconnaissance
- User profiling

**4. Further Attacks**
- Compromised credentials used for additional attacks
- Pivot point for network penetration
- Business email compromise (BEC)
- Lateral movement within organization
- Data exfiltration

### Example Attack Flow:

**Step 1:** User clicks phishing link
**Step 2:** Redirected to fake LinkedIn login page
**Step 3:** Page looks identical to real LinkedIn
**Step 4:** User enters username and password
**Step 5:** Attacker captures credentials
**Step 6:** Attacker logs into real LinkedIn account
**Step 7:** Attacker uses account for further attacks
**Step 8:** Credentials tested on other services (credential stuffing)
