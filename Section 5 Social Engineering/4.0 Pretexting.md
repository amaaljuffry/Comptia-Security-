# 4.0 Pretexting

## Overview
Pretexting is a social engineering technique where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretext) to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.

## Key Concepts

### What is Pretexting?
- Creating a believable false scenario to extract information
- Attacker assumes a fake identity or authority
- Uses psychological manipulation to gain trust
- Often part of a larger social engineering campaign

### Common Pretexting Scenarios

#### Technical Support Scams
- **Microsoft/Windows Support**: Caller claims computer is infected with malware
- Requests remote access to "fix" the problem
- Goal: Install malware or steal money/information

#### Vendor Impersonation
- Pretending to be from IT vendors, suppliers, or service providers
- Example: Toner/ink supply company needing printer details
- Uses seemingly innocent requests to gather reconnaissance

### Demonstration Example: Printer Toner Scam

**Initial Contact:**
- Attacker calls posing as "Ink and Toner Express"
- Claims there's a delay with toner order
- Needs to verify printer model to send correct supplies

**Information Gathering Technique:**
- Guesses common printer brand (HP, Epson, Lexmark)
- Victim corrects the guess, revealing actual model (Konica Minolta C368)
- Attacker acts like they "found" the order in their system

**Escalation Tactics:**
- After getting printer model, requests IP address
- Claims auto-shipment system isn't working
- Asks victim to check printer settings and provide network information
- Walks victim through steps to access sensitive data

### Why Pretexting Works

**Psychological Factors:**
1. **Authority**: Impersonating legitimate vendors or support staff
2. **Urgency**: Creating time pressure ("running out of supplies")
3. **Helpfulness**: Appealing to victim's desire to be cooperative
4. **Plausibility**: Using likely scenarios (most businesses have printers)

**Filling in the Gaps:**
- Attacker provides partial information
- Victim naturally fills in missing details
- Seemingly innocent information reveals security vulnerabilities

## Real-World Example: Windows Malware Scam

**Scenario:**
- Caller claims to be from Microsoft
- States victim's Windows machine is "calling out" with malware
- Requests victim perform steps to "clean" the infection
- Actually leads to:
  - Installing actual malware
  - Granting remote access
  - Paying fake "service fees"

**Defense:** Know your system (example: iMac user knows they don't run Windows)

## Information That Seems Innocent But Isn't

### Examples of "Harmless" Data:
- **Printer model numbers**: Reveals hardware vulnerabilities
- **IP addresses**: Network topology and attack vectors
- **Software versions**: Identifies exploitable vulnerabilities
- **Employee names**: Used for further social engineering
- **Department structures**: Organizational reconnaissance

### Attack Vector Development:
Information gathered through pretexting enables:
- Targeted phishing campaigns
- Network penetration attempts
- Physical security breaches
- Supply chain attacks

## Defense Against Pretexting

### User Training
**Key Principles:**
1. Never give information out over the phone to unsolicited callers
2. Verify caller identity through independent channels
3. Don't fill in gaps or correct "mistakes" for callers
4. Be suspicious of urgency and pressure tactics

### Organizational Policies
- Establish verification procedures for information requests
- Create callback protocols for vendor verification
- Define what information employees can share
- Implement "need to know" information access controls

### Warning Signs
- Unsolicited calls requesting technical information
- Pressure to act quickly
- Requests to bypass normal procedures
- Caller has partial information seeking confirmation
- Appeals to helpfulness or cooperation

## Pretexting in Penetration Testing

### Legitimate Uses:
- Security testing and awareness training
- Identifying security weaknesses in human factors
- Demonstrating real-world attack scenarios
- Building organizational security culture

### Ethical Considerations:
- Must have proper authorization
- Part of documented security assessment
- Used to improve security, not exploit it

## Best Practices

### For Employees:
1. **Verify, verify, verify**: Always confirm caller identity independently
2. **Use established channels**: Call back using known company numbers
3. **Question urgency**: Legitimate vendors rarely create artificial pressure
4. **Report suspicious calls**: Alert security team immediately
5. **When in doubt, refuse**: Better to be cautious than compromised

### For Organizations:
1. **Regular training**: Keep security awareness fresh
2. **Simulated attacks**: Test employee readiness
3. **Clear policies**: Document information sharing rules
4. **Incident reporting**: Make it easy to report suspicious contacts
5. **Feedback loops**: Share lessons learned from incidents

## Key Takeaways
- Pretexting uses false scenarios to manipulate victims
- Seemingly innocent information can enable serious attacks
- Psychological manipulation exploits trust and helpfulness
- Defense requires training, policies, and healthy skepticism
- Always verify before sharing any organizational information
