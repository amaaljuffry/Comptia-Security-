## Topic: Other Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. Diversion Theft

**Definition:**  
Manipulating a situation or creating a distraction to steal valuable items or information.

**Examples:**
- **Physical:** Creating a scene to divert attention while an accomplice steals items.
- **Digital:** Diverting internet traffic to fake websites to steal data (e.g., **DNS spoofing attack**).

**DNS Spoofing Explanation:**

- The attacker alters DNS settings so users visiting a legitimate website are redirected to a fake one.
- The fake site imitates the real brand and steals login details or financial data.

**Prevention:**

- Verify URLs before entering credentials.
- Use DNS security extensions and HTTPS.

### 2. Hoaxes

**Definition:**  
Malicious deceptions spread via email, social media, or messages that cause panic or spread malware.

**Example:**  
Fake alerts claiming your system is infected (e.g., Windows virus alert on a Mac).

**Prevention:**
- Apply **critical thinking** and **fact-check** suspicious messages.
- Verify information from **reliable sources** before acting.

### 3. Shoulder Surfing

**Definition:**  
Stealing information by observing someone entering PINs, passwords, or data — either directly or via cameras.

**Prevention:**

- Be aware of surroundings when entering sensitive data.
- Use **privacy screens** in offices.
- Shield keypads when entering PINs or passwords.
### 4. Dumpster Diving

**Definition:**  
Searching through trash (physical or digital) for confidential information.

**Examples:**
- **Physical:** Finding discarded documents, invoices, or personal info.
- **Digital:** Accessing deleted or “recycled” files on drives or cloud storage.

**Prevention:**
- **Shred** sensitive documents.
- Enforce a **clean desk policy**.
- Properly **delete and overwrite** digital files.

### 5. Eavesdropping

**Definition:**  
Secretly listening to private conversations or intercepting digital communications.

**Examples:**
- Listening to phone calls.
- Conducting **man-in-the-middle** (on-path) attacks on networks.

**Prevention:**
- Use **encrypted communication channels** (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs).
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit.
- Regularly **patch and update** systems.

### 6. Baiting

**Definition:**  
Enticing victims to take an action (e.g., plug in a USB) that infects systems with malware.

**Example:**  
A malware-infected USB left in a parking lot.

**Prevention:**
- Never use unknown USBs or external devices.
- Train users on **security awareness** and **social engineering risks**.

### 7. Piggybacking vs Tailgating

**Definition:**  
Both involve unauthorized individuals entering secure areas by following authorized personnel.

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tailgating**|Attacker follows an employee **without their knowledge**.|An attacker slips in behind an employee before the door closes.|
|**Piggybacking**|Attacker **convinces** someone to let them in.|Attacker poses as a delivery person, asks an employee to hold the door.|

**Prevention:**
- Implement **access control systems** (badges, biometrics).
- Educate employees **not to hold doors** for strangers.
- Maintain **visitor logs** and surveillance.
### 🧩 Summary Table

|**Attack Type**|**Method**|**Goal**|**Prevention**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Diversion Theft|Redirect goods or data|Theft of property/data|Verify traffic, secure DNS|
|Hoaxes|Spread false information|Cause panic, deliver malware|Fact-check, verify sources|
|Shoulder Surfing|Observe information input|Steal credentials|Privacy screens, awareness|
|Dumpster Diving|Search trash or deleted files|Obtain confidential data|Shred docs, clean desk policy|
|Eavesdropping|Intercept communication|Steal info or credentials|Encrypt channels|
|Baiting|Leave infected devices|Install malware|Avoid unknown devices|
|Piggybacking / Tailgating|Unauthorized entry|Physical access|Enforce access control|
