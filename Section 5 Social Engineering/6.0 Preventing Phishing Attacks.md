# 6.0 Preventing Phishing Attacks

## Overview
Phishing attacks are one of the most pervasive attack vectors used today. While they can lead to significant financial loss and data breaches, implementing proper strategies and security awareness training can effectively mitigate these threats.

## Anti-Phishing Campaigns

### Purpose
Essential user security awareness training tool that educates individuals about phishing risks and identification techniques.

### Components
1. **Training Sessions** - Education on phishing techniques and threats
2. **Simulated Phishing Campaigns** - Practical experience in spotting attacks
3. **Outside Contractors/SaaS Platforms** - Professional campaign execution
4. **Hands-on Practice** - Real-world scenario response training

### Coverage Areas
- Phishing (general)
- Spear phishing
- Whaling
- Business email compromise (BEC)
- Vishing
- Smishing
- Other relevant cyber threats

### Ongoing Effort
- Cybersecurity threats continually evolve
- Regular training updates required
- Remedial training for those who fall victim to simulations
- Continuous improvement of detection skills

## Key Phishing Indicators

### 1. Urgency
**Definition:** Phishing emails create artificial time pressure to prompt immediate action.

**Example:**
- "You've won a brand-new iPhone!"
- "Click link to claim within 4 hours or offer expires"
- "Account will be closed unless you act now"

**Why It Works:**
- Bypasses rational thinking
- Creates fear of missing out
- Prevents careful verification 
- Encourages hasty decisions

**Defense:** Be suspicious of any message demanding immediate action.

### 2. Unusual Requests
**Definition:** Requests for sensitive information that legitimate organizations would never ask for.

**Red Flags:**
- Requests for passwords
- Credit card numbers via email
- Social Security numbers
- Banking credentials
- Personal identification information

**Important Rules:**
- **Technical support will NEVER ask for login information**
- **Banks will NEVER ask for credit card numbers via email or phone**
- Any such request should immediately trigger suspicion

**Defense:** Always verify through official channels before providing any sensitive information.

### 3. Mismatched URLs
**Definition:** Display text that doesn't match the actual underlying URL destination.

**How It Works:**
- HTML emails show display text (what you read)
- Underlying URL can be different (where you actually go)
- Example: "Click here" text might link to any website

**Common Brand Impersonation:**
- Display text shows: `paypal.com/login`
- Actual URL is: `paypal.hacked.xyz`
- Appears legitimate but redirects to malicious site

**Detection Method:**
**Hover your mouse over the link for a few seconds** to reveal actual URL

**What to Check:**
- Does text URL match underlying URL?
- Is domain legitimate?
- Any suspicious characters or misspellings?

**Reality Check:**
Despite being an old and simple trick, users still fall for this technique regularly in modern enterprises.

### 4. Suspicious Email Addresses
**Definition:** Sender's displayed email address doesn't match actual sending address.

**How Email Spoofing Works:**
- Email address you see = display name (can be faked)
- Actual sending address = hidden underneath
- Similar to URL mismatch technique

**Detection Methods:**
1. **Hover over display email address** to see real address
2. **Double-click display email address** to reveal actual sender

**Warning Signs:**
- Real and displayed addresses don't match
- Organization's official domain not used
- Overly complicated email address
- Random characters or numbers
- Free email services (yahoo.com, gmail.com) for "official" business

**Common Examples:**
- Claims to be Microsoft tech support
- Appears to be from PayPal
- Says it's Amazon customer support
- Pretends to be financial institution
- **Actual address:** `mr.weirdo578@yahoo.com`

**Most Commonly Used Technique:**
This is one of the most prevalent phishing indicators, appearing multiple times daily in most inboxes.

**Action:** Mark as spam and delete without clicking any links.

### 5. Poor Grammar and Spelling
**Definition:** Professional organizations proofread communications; phishing emails often contain errors.

**Traditional Indicators:**
- Broken English
- Poor grammar
- Numerous spelling errors
- Awkward phrasing

**Modern Challenge:**
- Generative AI (ChatGPT, Google Bard) makes creating proper emails easy
- Attackers can now produce grammatically correct phishing emails
- This indicator is becoming less reliable

**Why Errors Still Exist:**
**INTENTIONAL FILTERING STRATEGY:**

Attackers often purposely include errors to:
1. **Filter out suspicious users** - Those who catch errors won't proceed
2. **Target gullible victims** - Focus on those who ignore red flags
3. **Increase profitability** - More likely to succeed with less cautious users
4. **Avoid overwhelming success** - Too perfect = too many victims to handle

**Result:** Only the most vulnerable users proceed, making attacks more efficient.

## Response Procedures

### If You Suspect Phishing

#### Individual Actions:
1. **Do NOT click any links** in the email
2. **Do NOT provide any information**
3. **Report immediately** to your organization
