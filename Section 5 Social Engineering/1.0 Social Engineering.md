# Social Engineering - Introduction

## What is Social Engineering?

**Social engineering** is a manipulative strategy that exploits human psychology to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or physical spaces.

### Key Characteristics
- Targets the **human element** rather than technical vulnerabilities
- Uses psychological manipulation instead of technical hacking
- Includes both written communication and face-to-face interaction
- Exploits trust, authority, and human nature

### Attack Methodology
Social engineers manipulate people into:
- Revealing confidential information
- Performing actions that compromise security
- Granting unauthorized access
- Bypassing security controls

## Types of Social Engineering Techniques

### Communication-Based Attacks
- **Phishing** - Fraudulent emails to steal information
- **Vishing** - Voice-based phishing over phone calls
- **Smishing** - SMS/text message-based phishing
- **Spear Phishing** - Targeted phishing against specific individuals
- **Whaling** - Phishing attacks targeting high-level executives
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** - Impersonating business executives

### Deception-Based Attacks
- **Pretexting** - Creating fabricated scenarios to obtain information
- **Impersonation** - Pretending to be someone else
- **Brand Impersonation** - Mimicking trusted brands
- **Typosquatting** - Using misspelled domain names
- **Waterholing** - Compromising websites frequented by targets

### Physical Access Attacks
- **Baiting** - Offering something enticing to compromise security
- **Tailgating** - Following authorized person through secure entry
- **Piggybacking** - Gaining access with authorized person's help
- **Shoulder Surfing** - Observing sensitive information over shoulder
- **Dumpster Diving** - Searching trash for sensitive information
- **Eavesdropping** - Listening to private conversations

### Information Warfare
- **Misinformation** - False information spread unintentionally
- **Disinformation** - False information spread intentionally
- **Influence Campaigns** - Coordinated efforts to manipulate opinions
- **Hoaxes** - Deliberate deceptions

### Other Attacks
- **Diversion Theft** - Creating distractions to steal items
- **Frauds and Scams** - Deceptive practices to steal money or information

## CompTIA Security+ Exam Objectives Covered

### Objective 2.2
**"Explain common threat vectors and attack surfaces"**

Focus on human-based attack vectors:
- Phishing, vishing, smishing
- Misinformation and disinformation
- Impersonation
- Business email compromise
- Pretexting
- Waterholing
- Brand impersonation
- Typosquatting

### Objective 5.6
**"Given a scenario, implement security awareness practices"**

Focus on defensive measures:
- Conducting anti-phishing campaigns
- Security awareness training
- End user education programs
- Recognition and response training

## Primary Defense: Security Awareness Training

### Why Training is Critical
Since social engineering attacks target the **human element**, technical controls alone are insufficient. People are both:
- The weakest link in security
- The strongest defense when properly trained

### Training Components
- **Recognition** - Identify social engineering attempts
- **Response** - Proper actions when targeted
- **Reporting** - How to alert security teams
- **Prevention** - Best practices to avoid attacks
- **Regular Updates** - Ongoing education on new techniques

### Training Types
- **Anti-phishing campaigns** - Simulated phishing tests
- **Security awareness programs** - Comprehensive education
- **Role-based training** - Targeted for specific positions
- **Incident response drills** - Practice handling attacks

## Motivational Triggers Used by Social Engineers

Social engineers exploit psychological triggers to manipulate targets:

### 1. Familiarity
- Pretending to know the target
- Using personal information to build rapport
- Creating sense of existing relationship

### 2. Likability
- Being friendly and personable
- Making target feel comfortable
- Building emotional connection

### 3. Consensus and Social Proof
- "Everyone else is doing it"
- Creating false sense of normalcy
- Using peer pressure tactics

### 4. Authority and Intimidation
- Impersonating authority figures (police, executives, IT)
- Using threatening language
- Creating sense of urgency through fear

### 5. Scarcity and Urgency
- "Limited time offer"
- "Act now or lose access"
- Creating pressure to bypass normal procedures

## Key Concepts to Remember

### Attack Surface
Social engineering expands the attack surface beyond technical vulnerabilities to include:
- Human psychology
- Organizational culture
- Trust relationships
- Communication channels

### Defense Strategy
**Multi-layered approach:**
1. Technical controls (email filters, access controls)
2. Policy and procedures (verification protocols)
3. **Human awareness (training and education)** ← Most critical
4. Incident response (detection and remediation)

### Human Element
- Humans are the primary target
- Psychology is the attack vector
- Awareness is the primary defense
- Regular training is essential

### Why Social Engineering Works
- Exploits natural human tendencies
- Bypasses technical security controls
- Requires minimal technical skill
- High success rate
- Difficult to detect with technology alone

## Digital and Physical Environment Protection

Social engineering threatens both:

**Digital Environment:**
- System access
- Data breaches
- Credential theft
- Malware installation

**Physical Environment:**
- Building access
- Sensitive area entry
- Equipment theft
- Document compromise

**Solution:** Comprehensive security awareness training that addresses both digital and physical threats
