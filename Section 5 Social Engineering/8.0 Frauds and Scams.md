# 8.0 Frauds and Scams

## Overview
Frauds and scams are forms of social engineering that use deception to achieve financial or personal gain. Unlike direct theft, these attacks trick victims into voluntarily handing over valuables, information, or money.

## Fraud

### Key Characteristics:

- Relies on manipulation and trust exploitation

### Fraud vs. Theft
**Fraud:**
- Victim voluntarily provides assets
- Based on deception and manipulation
- Social engineering component
- Attacker gains through trickery

**Theft:**
- Attacker takes assets directly
- No voluntary transfer
- Breaking into accounts or systems

### Common Target
**Businesses** - especially targeting employees who handle:

### Attack Scenario: Toner/Printer Supplies Scam

#### Phase 1: Initial Contact
**Phone Call to Employee:**

Attacker asks basic questions:
- "What type of printer do you have?"
- "Are you still using the HP LaserJet A330?"

**Purpose:** Establish pretext and gather information
#### Phase 2: Information Gathering
**Employee Response:**

**Scenario A - Attacker Guesses Correctly:**
- Employee: "Yes, that's correct"
- Attacker proceeds with fake order

**Scenario B - Attacker Guesses Wrong:**
- Employee: "No, we use the Lexmark B612 printer"
- Attacker adapts: "Oh, I'll fix that in the order"
- Employee fills in correct information

**Psychological Tactic:** Employees naturally correct mistakes and provide accurate information

#### Phase 3: Order "Confirmation"
**Attacker's Script:**
- "I have an order for two boxes of toner ready to ship"
- "Should arrive tomorrow, okay?"
- Employee responds: "Yes" or "Okay"

**Critical Element:** **Attacker records the "yes" or "okay" response**

#### Phase 4: Delivery
- Boxes of toner arrive at office
- Employee thinks order was verified during phone call
- Appears legitimate
- No immediate suspicion

#### Phase 5: The Scam Revealed
**Inflated Invoice Arrives:**

**Price Comparison:**
- Retail (Amazon/Office Depot): $100 per box
- Scam invoice: $950 for two boxes
- **Markup:** Nearly 5x retail price

**Invoice Terms:**
- "No refunds or returns"
- "No exchanges"

- Has employee's "yes/okay" as authorization.

### Why It's Called Invoice Scam
