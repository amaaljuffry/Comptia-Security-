# 5.0 Phishing Attacks

## Overview
Phishing is a category of social engineering attacks that use fraudulent communications to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. These attacks disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to manipulate targets.

## Types of Phishing Attacks

### 1. Phishing (General)
**Definition:** Sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources to convince individuals to reveal personal information.

**Characteristics:**
- Wide-net approach (mass campaigns)
- Sent to hundreds of thousands of recipients
- "Spray and pray" methodology
- Low customization
- Targets random individuals

**How It Works:**
- Creates sense of urgency or fear
- Prompts clicking on malicious links or attachments
- Leads to theft of sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers)
- Impersonates trusted sources

**Analogy:** Like a fisherman casting a wide net into the sea, hoping to catch as many fish as possible.

**Example:**
- Email appears to be from Google
- Asks to verify identity by logging in
- Victim enters email and password
- Attacker captures and steals credentials

**Statistics Example:**
- Email to 1 million random Americans impersonating Bank of America
- 68 million Americans have Bank of America accounts (out of 340 million total)
- 1 in 5 Americans is a Bank of America customer
- Some recipients will likely fall for the trick

### 2. Spear Phishing
**Definition:** A targeted form of phishing focused on specific individuals or organizations with personalized attacks.

**Characteristics:**
- Highly targeted and sophisticated
- Requires detailed reconnaissance
- Higher level of customization
- More convincing and harder to detect
- Higher success rate than general phishing

**Key Differences from Phishing:**
- **Phishing:** Wide net, untargeted, spray and pray
- **Spear Phishing:** Narrow focus, specific targets, researched approach

**Attack Process:**
1. Gather detailed information about targets
2. Create personalized, convincing messages
3. Target only known connections to organization
4. Craft emails tailored to recipients

**Analogy:** Like a hunter studying their prey's habits and behaviors before striking.

**Example:**
- Financial institution "Dion Savings and Loan" suffers data breach
- Customer names and emails posted on dark web
- Attacker selects 500 people from that specific list
- Sends targeted emails only to confirmed customers
- Much higher success rate due to personalization

**Why More Effective:**
- Victims recognize the organization (they actually have accounts there)
- Personalized details make it seem legitimate
- Harder to identify as attack vector
- More limited scope but higher precision

### 3. Whaling
**Definition:** A form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like CEOs, CFOs, or executives.

**Characteristics:**
- Targets "big fish" (executives, board members, senior managers)
- Requires significant preparation and precision
- Potentially massive financial gains
- Often first step in larger organizational attack
- More challenging to execute successfully

**Why Target Executives:**
- Authority to approve large fund transfers
- Access to sensitive company information
- Compromised account can be used for further attacks
- Greater potential rewards justify effort

**Strategic Use:**
- Take over executive's account
- Use compromised account for subsequent attacks
- Leverage executive authority for malicious actions
- Access high-value information and systems

### 4. Business Email Compromise (BEC)
**Definition:** Sophisticated phishing attack that uses internal email accounts to trick employees into performing malicious actions.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses legitimate business email accounts
- Impersonates senior executives or trusted partners
- Targets employees in finance or HR
- Highly costly and damaging

**Attack Methods:**
- Takes over legitimate email through social engineering
- Uses cyber intrusion techniques
- Relies on trust established by compromised account
- Sends seemingly legitimate requests

**Common Targets:**
- Unauthorized fund transfers
- Payment redirection
- Confidential data requests
- Wire transfer approvals

**Impact:**
- Significant financial losses
- Data breaches
- Compromised business operations

**FBI Statistics:**
- 14.5% increase in BEC attacks (last year)
- $2.7 billion in business losses
- Significant and costly threat to organizations

**Why BEC Works:**
- Uses trusted internal email addresses
- Appears legitimate to recipients
- Exploits organizational authority structures
- Recipients less suspicious of internal communications

### 5. Vishing (Voice Phishing)
**Definition:** Attack that tricks victims into sharing personal or financial information over the phone.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses voice communication instead of email
- Impersonates legitimate organizations
- Targets banks, government agencies, tech support
- Often more effective than email phishing

**Attack Techniques:**
- Social engineering over phone calls
- Creates urgency and pressure
- Exploits people's natural friendliness
- Manipulates victims into providing data

**Why Vishing is Effective:**
- People tend to be more trusting on phone
- Easier to trick people verbally than via email
- Voice adds legitimacy and urgency
- Harder to verify caller identity
- Real-time manipulation possible

**Example Scenario:**
- Attacker pretends to be bank representative
- Tricks victim into revealing banking information
- Requests actions that compromise security
- May ask for passwords, PINs, or account numbers

### 6. Smishing (SMS Phishing)
**Definition:** Attack using text messages to trick individuals into providing personal information.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses SMS/text messaging
- Contains links to fraudulent websites
- Includes phone numbers to call
- Creates sense of urgency
- Baits victims into immediate action

**Common Tactics:**
- "Your account has been compromised"
- "Click here to verify your identity"
- "Call this number immediately"
- "You've won a prize - claim now"

**Delivery Methods:**
- Malicious links to fake websites
- Phone numbers for vishing follow-up
- Requests for immediate response
- Exploits mobile device trust

## Common Phishing Indicators

### Red Flags to Watch For:
1. **Urgency and pressure** - "Act now or account will be closed"
2. **Suspicious sender addresses** - Slight misspellings or unusual domains
3. **Generic greetings** - "Dear Customer" instead of your name
4. **Requests for sensitive information** - Legitimate companies don't ask via email
5. **Poor grammar and spelling** - Professional companies proofread
6. **Suspicious links** - Hover to reveal actual URL destination
7. **Unexpected attachments** - Especially executable files
8. **Too good to be true** - Lottery winnings, free prizes


## Defense Strategies

### Individual Protection:
1. **Verify sender identity** - Contact organization through official channels
2. **Inspect links before clicking** - Hover to see actual destination
3. **Never share sensitive information** - Via email, phone, or text without verification
4. **Use multi-factor authentication** - Adds security layer
5. **Keep software updated** - Security patches protect against exploits
6. **Be skeptical of urgency** - Legitimate organizations allow time to verify
7. **Report suspicious messages** - Help protect others

### Organizational Protection:
1. **Security awareness training** - Regular phishing education
2. **Simulated phishing campaigns** - Test and train employees
3. **Email filtering and authentication** - SPF, DKIM, DMARC
4. **Verification procedures** - Especially for financial transactions
5. **Incident response plan** - Quick action when attacks occur
6. **Access controls** - Limit who can approve transactions
7. **Monitoring and detection** - Identify suspicious activities

## Attack Progression Levels

**Level 1: General Phishing**
- Broad, untargeted campaigns
- Generic messages
- Low sophistication
- High volume, low success rate

**Level 2: Spear Phishing**
- Targeted individuals or groups
- Researched and personalized
- Medium sophistication
- Lower volume, higher success rate

**Level 3: Whaling/BEC**
- High-value targets
- Highly sophisticated
- Extensive preparation
- Very low volume, very high impact

## Key Takeaways
- **Phishing is a category**, not just a single attack type
- Includes: phishing, spear phishing, whaling, BEC, vishing, smishing
